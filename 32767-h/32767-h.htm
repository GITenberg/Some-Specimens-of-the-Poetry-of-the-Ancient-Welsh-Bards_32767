<p>I hope you will pardon my presumption in prefixing your name
to the following small collection of British poems, to which you
have a just claim, as being lineally descended from those heroes
they celebrate, and retain in an eminent manner the worth and
generous principles of your renowned ancestors.&nbsp; The British
Bards were received by the nobility and gentry with distinguished
marks of esteem, in every part of Wales, and particularly at
Gloddaith and Mostyn, where their works are still preserved in
your curious libraries.&nbsp; I hope, therefore, an attempt to
give the public a small specimen of their works will not fail of
your approbation, which the editor flatters himself with, from
the generous manner with which you treated him, particularly by
lending him some of your valuable books and manuscripts.</p>
<p>That you may long continue to be an ornament to your country,
and a pattern of virtuous actions, and a generous patron of
learning, is the sincere wish, of,</p>

7</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>As there is a natural curiosity in most people to be brought
acquainted with the works of men, whose names have been conveyed
down to us with applause from very early antiquity, I have been
induced to think, that a translation of some of the Welsh Bards
would be no unacceptable present to the public.&nbsp; It is true
they lived in times when all Europe was enveloped with the dark
cloud of bigotry and ignorance; yet, even under these
disadvantageous circumstances, a late instance may convince us,
that poetry shone forth with a light, that seems astonishing to
many readers.&nbsp; They who have perused the works of Ossian, as
translated by Mr. Macpherson, will, I believe, be of my
opinion.</p>
<p>I mean not to set the following poems in competition with
those just mentioned; nor did the success which they have met
with from the world, put me upon this undertaking.&nbsp; It was
first thought of, and encouraged some years before the name of
Ossian was known in England.&nbsp; I had long been convinced,
that no nation in Europe possesses greater remains of ancient and
genuine pieces of this kind than the Welsh; and therefore was
inclined, in honour to my country, to give a specimen of them in
the English language.</p>
<p>As to the genuineness of these poems, I think there can be no
doubt; but though we may vie with the Scottish nation in this
particular, yet there is another point, in which we must yield to
them undoubtedly.&nbsp; The language of their oldest poets, it
seems, is still perfectly intelligible, which is by no means our
case.</p>
<p>The works of Taliesin, Llywarch H&ecirc;n, Aneurin Gwawdrydd,
Myrddin Wyllt, Avan Verddig, who all flourished about the year
560, a considerable time after Ossian, are hardly understood by
the best critics and antiquarians in Wales, though our language
has not undergone more changes than the Erse.&nbsp; Nay, the
Bards that wrote a long while after, from the time of William the
Conquerer to the death of Prince Llewelyn, are not so easy to be
understood; but that whoever goes about to translate them, will
find numerous obsolete words, not to be found in any Dictionary
or Glossary, either in print or manuscript.</p>
<p>What this difference is owing to, I leave to be determined by
others, who are better acquainted, than I am, with such
circumstances of the Scottish Highlands, as might prove more
favourable towards keeping up the perfect knowledge of their
language for so many generations.&nbsp; But, be that as it may,
it is not my intent to enter into the dispute, which has arisen
in relation to the antiquity of Ossian&rsquo;s poems.&nbsp; My
concern is only about the opinion the world may entertain of the
intrinsic value of those which I offer.&nbsp; They seem to me,
though not so methodical and regular in their composition as many
poems of other nations, yet not to be wanting in poetical merit;
and if I am not totally deceived in my judgment, I <!-- page
8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>shall
have no reason to repent of the pains I have taken to draw them
out of that state of obscurity, in which they have hitherto been
buried, and in which they run great risk of mouldering away.</p>
<p>It might perhaps be expected, that I should say something of
the Bards in general on this occasion; but as I have treated that
subject in my Latin Dissertation, which I shall annex to these
translations, it will be sufficient to observe here, that the
usual subjects of their poems were the brave feats of their
warriors in the field, their hospitality and generosity, with
other commendable qualities in domestic life, and elegies upon
their great men, which were sung to the harp at their feasts,
before a numerous audience of their friends and relations.&nbsp;
This is the account that the Greek and Roman writers have given
of them, as I have shown at large in the above-mentioned
treatise, which I intend to publish.</p>
<p>The following poems, from among many others of greater length,
and of equal merit, were taken from a manuscript of the learned
Dr. Davies, author of the Dictionary, which he had transcribed
from an ancient vellom MS. which was wrote, partly in Edward the
Second and Third&rsquo;s time, and partly in Henry the
Fifth&rsquo;s, containing the works of all the Bards from the
Conquest to the death of Llewelyn, the last prince of the British
line.&nbsp; This is a noble treasure, and very rare to be met
with; for Edward the First ordered all our Bards, and their
works, to be destroyed, as is attested by Sir John Wynne of
Gwydir, in the history he compiled of his ancestors at
Carnarvon.&nbsp; What remained of their works were conveyed in
his time to the Exchequer, where he complains they lay in great
confusion, when he had occasion to consult them.</p>
<p>As to the translation, I have endeavoured to render the sense
of the Bards faithfully, without confining myself to too servile
a version; nor have I, on the other hand, taken liberty to wander
much from the originals; unless where I saw it absolutely
necessary, on account of the different phraseology and idiom of
language.</p>
<p>If this small collection has the good fortune to merit the
attention of the public, I may, in some future time, if God
permit me life and health, proceed to translate other select
pieces from the same manuscript.&nbsp; The poems, in the
original, have great merit; and if there is none in the
translation of this specimen, it must be owing entirely to my
inability to do the Bards justice.&nbsp; I am not the only person
who admires them: men of the greatest sense and learning in Wales
do the same.</p>
<p>It must be owned, that it is an arduous task to bring them to
make any tolerable figure in a prose translation; but those who
have any candour, will make allowances.&nbsp; What was said of
poetry in general by one of the wits, that <i>it is but Prose run
mad</i>, may very justly be applied to our Bards in particular:
for there are not such extravagant flights in any poetic
compositions, except it be in the Eastern, to which, as far as I
can judge by the few translated specimens I have seen, they bear
a great resemblance.</p>
<p>I have added a few Notes, to illustrate some historical facts
alluded to in the poems, and a short account of each poem, and
the occasion it was written upon, as far as it could be traced
from our ancient manuscripts.</p>
<p>I have been obliged to leave blanks in some places, where I
did not understand the meaning in the original, as I had but one
copy by me, which might be faulty.&nbsp; When I have an
opportunity to collate it with other copies, I may clear these
obscure passages.</p>

9</span>SPECIMENS OF ANCIENT WELSH POETRY.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>A</i> <span class="smcap">poem</span>
<i>composed by Owain Cyveiliog</i>, <i>prince of Powys</i>,
<i>entitled by him</i> <span class="smcap">Hirlas</span>, <i>from
a large drinking horn so called</i>, <i>used at feasts in his
palace</i>.&nbsp; <i>He was driven out of his country by Owain
Gwynedd</i>, <i>prince of North Wales</i>, <i>and
Rhys-ap-Griffydd-ap-Rhys-ap-Tewdwr</i>, <i>prince of South
Wales</i>, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1167, <i>and recovered
it</i>, <i>by the help of the Normans and English</i>, <i>under
Henry the second</i>.&nbsp; <i>He flourished about</i> <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1160, <i>in the time of Owain Gwynedd
and his son David</i>.&nbsp; <i>This poem was composed on account
of a battle fought with the English at Maelor</i>, <i>which is a
part of the counties of Denbigh and Flint</i>, <i>according to
the modern division</i>.</p>
<p>When the dawn arose, the shout was given; the enemy gave an
ominous presage; our men were stained with blood, after a hard
contest; and the borders of Maelor Drefred were beheld with
wonder and astonishment.&nbsp; Strangers have I driven away
undaunted from the field with bloody arms.&nbsp; He that provokes
the brave man, ought to dread his resentment.</p>
<p>Fill, cup-bearer, fill with alacrity the horn of Rhys, in the
generous prince&rsquo;s hall; for Owain&rsquo;s hall was ever
supported by spoils taken from the enemy; and in it thou hearest
of the relief of thousands.&nbsp; There the gates are ever
open.</p>
<p>O cup-bearer, who, with patience, mindest thy duty, forsake us
not; fetch the horn, that we may drink together, whose gloss is
like the wave of the sea; whose <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>green handles
shew the skill of the artist, and are tipped with gold.&nbsp;
Bring the best meath, and put it in Gwgan Draws&rsquo;s hand, for
the noble feats which he hath achieved: the offspring of Gronwy,
who valiantly fought in the midst of dangers; a race of heroes
for worthy acts renowned: and men, who, in every hardship they
undergo, deserve a reward; who are in the battle foremost: the
guardians of Sabrina.&nbsp; Their friends exult, when they hear
their voice.&nbsp; The festal shout will cease when they are
gone.</p>
<p>Fill thou the yellow-tipped horn, badge of honour and mirth,
full of frothing meath; and if thou art desirous to have thy life
prolonged to the year&rsquo;s end, stop not the reward due to his
virtue, for it is unjust; and bring it to Griffydd, with the
crimson lance.&nbsp; Bring wine in the transparent horn; for he
is the guardian of Arwystli, <a name="citation10a"></a><a
href="#footnote10a" class="citation">[10a]</a> the defence of its
borders; a dragon of Owain the generous, whose descent is from
Cynvyn; a dragon he was from the beginning, that never was
terrified in the battle; his brave actions shall follow
him.&nbsp; The warriors went to purchase renown, flushed with
liquor, and armed like Edwin; they paid for their mead, like
Belyn&rsquo;s <a name="citation10b"></a><a href="#footnote10b"
class="citation">[10b]</a> men, in the days of yore.&nbsp; And as
long as men exist, their valour shall be the common theme of
Bards.</p>
<p>Fill thou the horn; for it is my inclination, that we may
converse in mirth and festivity with our brave general; put it in
the hand of the worthy Ednyfed, with his spear broken to pieces,
and his shield pierced through.</p>
<p>Like the bursting of a hurricane upon the smooth sea . . . in
the conflict of battle, they <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>would soon
break in pieces the sides of a golden-bordered shield: their
lances were besmeared with gore, after piercing the heads of
their enemies; they were vigorous and active in the defence of
delightful Garthan. <a name="citation11a"></a><a
href="#footnote11a" class="citation">[11a]</a>&nbsp; Heard ye in
Maelor the noise of war, the horrid din of arms, their furious
onset, loud as in the battle of Bangor, <a
name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b"
class="citation">[11b]</a> where fire flashed out of their
spears?&nbsp; There two princes engaged, when the carousing of
Morach Vorvran <a name="citation11c"></a><a href="#footnote11c"
class="citation">[11c]</a> happened.</p>
<p>Fill thou the horn; for it is my delight, in the place where
the defenders of our country drink mead, and give it to Selyf the
fearless, the defence of Gwygyr; <a name="citation11d"></a><a
href="#footnote11d" class="citation">[11d]</a> woe to the wretch
that offends him, eagle-hearted hero: and to the son of Madoc,
the famous and generous Tudur, like a wolf when he seizes his
prey, is his assault in the onset.&nbsp; Two heroes, who were
sage in their counsels, but active in the field, the two sons of
Ynyr, who, on the day of battle, were ready for the attack,
heedless of danger, famous for their exploits; their assault was
like that of strong lions, and they pierced their enemies like
brave warriors; they were lords of the battle, and rushed
foremost <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>with their crimson lances; the weight
of their attack was not to be withstood; their shields were broke
asunder with much force, as the high-sounding wind on the beach
of the green sea, and the encroaching of the furious waves on the
coast of Talgarth. <a name="citation12a"></a><a
href="#footnote12a" class="citation">[12a]</a></p>
<p>Fill, cup-bearer, as thou regardest thy life; fill the horn,
badge of honour at feasts, the hirlas <a
name="citation12b"></a><a href="#footnote12b"
class="citation">[12b]</a> drinking-horn, which is a token of
distinction, whose tip is adorned with silver, and it&rsquo;s
cover of the same metal; and bring it to Tudur, the eagle of
battles, filled with the best wine; and if thou dost not bring us
the best of all, thy head shall fly off: give it in the hand of
Moreiddig, encourager of songs, whose praise in battle is
celebrated; they were brethren of a distant clime, of an
undaunted heart, and their valour was observable in their
countenance.&nbsp; Can I forget their services? . . . Impetuous
warriors, wolves of the battle, their lances are besmeared with
gore; they were the heroes of the chief of Mochnant, <a
name="citation12c"></a><a href="#footnote12c"
class="citation">[12c]</a> in the region of Powys.&nbsp; Their
honour was soon purchased by them both; they seized every
occasion to defend their country, in the time of need, with their
bloody arms, and they kept their borders from hostile
invasion.&nbsp; Their lot is praise; it is like a mournful elegy
to me to lose them both!&nbsp; O Christ! how pensive am I for the
loss of Moreiddig, which is irreparable.</p>
<p>Pour thou out the horn, though they desire it not, the
drinking horn, hirlas, with cheerfulness, and deliver it into the
hand of Morgant, one who deserves to be celebrated with
distinguished praise.&nbsp; It was like poison to me, to be
deprived of him, and that he was pierced - - - - by the keen
sword.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>Pour, cup-bearer, from a silver vessel, an honourable
gift, badge of distinction.&nbsp; On the large plains of Gwestun
<a name="citation13a"></a><a href="#footnote13a"
class="citation">[13a]</a> I have seen a miracle; to stop the
impetuosity of Gronwy, was more than a task for an hundred
men.&nbsp; The warriors pointed their lances, courted the battle,
and were profuse of life; they met their enemies in the conflict,
and their chieftain was consumed by fire near the surges of the
sea. <a name="citation13b"></a><a href="#footnote13b"
class="citation">[13b]</a>&nbsp; They rescued a noble prisoner,
Meurig the son of Griffydd, of renowned valour; they were all of
them covered with blood when they returned, and the high hills
and the dales enjoyed the sun equally. <a
name="citation13c"></a><a href="#footnote13c"
class="citation">[13c]</a></p>
<p>Pour the horn to the warriors, Owain&rsquo;s noble heroes, who
were equally active and brave.&nbsp; They assembled in that
renowned place, where the shining steel glittered.&nbsp; Madoc
and Meilir were men accustomed to violence, and maintained each
other in the injuries they did to their enemies; they were the
shields of our army, and the teachers of warlike attack.&nbsp;
Hear ye, by drinking mead, how the lord of Cattraeth went with
his warriors in defence of his just cause, the guards of
Mynyddawc <a name="citation13d"></a><a href="#footnote13d"
class="citation">[13d]</a> about their distinguished chief.&nbsp;
They have been celebrated for their bravery, and their speedy
march.&nbsp; But nobody has ever performed so noble an exploit as
my warriors, in the tough land of Maelor, in rescuing the
captive.</p>
<p>Pour out, cup-bearer, sweet and well strained mead, (the
thrust of the spear is red in the time of need,) from the horns
of wild oxen, covered with gold, for the honour, <!-- page
14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>and
the reward of the souls of those departed heroes.&nbsp; Of the
numerous cares that surround princes, no one is conscious here
but God and myself.&nbsp; The man who neither gives nor takes
quarter, and cannot be forced by his enemies to abide to his
word, Daniel the valiant and beautiful: O cup-bearer, great is
the task to entreat him; his men will not cease dealing death
around them, till he is mollified.&nbsp; Cup-bearer, our shares
of mead are to be given us equally before the bright shining
tapers.&nbsp; Cup-bearer, hadst thou seen the action in the land
of Llidwm, <a name="citation14a"></a><a href="#footnote14a"
class="citation">[14a]</a> the men whom I honour have but what is
their just reward.&nbsp; Cup-bearer, hadst thou seen the armed
chiefs, encompassing Owain, who were his shield against the
violence of his foes, when Cawres <a name="citation14b"></a><a
href="#footnote14b" class="citation">[14b]</a> was invaded with
great fury.&nbsp; Cup-bearer, slight not my commands: may we all
be admitted into Paradise by the King of kings; and long may the
liberty and happiness of my heroes continue, where the truth is
to be discerned distinctly.</p>

name="citation15e"></a><a href="#footnote15e"

am, I lament my absence from the marble castle of Myfanwy.&nbsp;
Love is the heaviest burden, O thou that shinest like the
heavens, and a greater punishment cannot be inflicted than thy
displeasure, O beautiful Myfanwy.&nbsp; I who am plunged deeper
and deeper in love, can expect no other ease, O gentle fair
Myfanwy with the jet eyebrows, than to lose my life upon thy
account.&nbsp; I sung in golden verse thy praises, O Myfanwy;
this is the happiness of thy lover, but the happiness is a
misfortune.&nbsp; The well-fed steed carried me pensive like
Trystan, <a name="citation15f"></a><a href="#footnote15f"

golden summit of Bran.&nbsp; Daily I turn my eyes, and see thee,
O thou that shinest like the waves of Caswennan. <a

in the spacious royal palace of Bran.&nbsp; I have rode hard,

thou with the countenance of cherry-flower bloom.&nbsp; The speed
was with eagerness, and the strong long-ham&rsquo;d steed of
Alban <a name="citation16a"></a><a href="#footnote16a"
class="citation">[16a]</a> reached the summit of the highland of
Bran.&nbsp; I have composed, with great study and pains, thy
praise, O thou that shinest like the new-fallen snow on the brow

sorrowful complaint.&nbsp; I am wounded, and the great love I
bear thee will not suffer me to sleep, unless thou givest me a
kind answer.&nbsp; I, thy pensive Bard, am in as woeful plight as
Rhun <a name="citation16d"></a><a href="#footnote16d"

recite, without either flattery or guile, thy praise, O thou that
shinest like the meridian sun, with thy stately steps.&nbsp;
Should&rsquo;st thou, who art the luminary of many countries,
demand my two eyes, I would part with them on thy account, such
is the pain I suffer.&nbsp; They pain me while I look on the
glossy walls of thy fine habitation, and see thee beautiful as
the morning sun.&nbsp; I have meditated thy praise, and made all
countries resound with it, and every singer was pleased in
chanting it.&nbsp; So affecting are the subjects of my mournful
tale, O Myfanwy, <a name="citation16e"></a><a href="#footnote16e"
class="citation">[16e]</a> that lookest like flakes of driven
snow.&nbsp; My loving heart sinks with grief without thy support,
O thou that hast the whiteness of the curling waves.&nbsp; Heaven
has decreed, that I should suffer tormenting pain, and wisdom and
reason were given in vain to guard against love.&nbsp; When I saw
thy fine shape in scarlet robes, thou daughter of a generous
chief, I was so affected, that life and death were equal to
me.&nbsp; I sunk away, and scarce had <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>time to make
my confession.&nbsp; Alas! my labour in celebrating thy praises,
O thou that shinest like the fine spider&rsquo;s webs on the
grass in a summer&rsquo;s day, is vain.&nbsp; It would be a hard
task for any man to guess how great my pain is.&nbsp; It is so
afflicting, thou bright luminary of maids, that my colour is
gone.&nbsp; I know that this pain will avail me nothing towards
obtaining thy love, O thou whose countenance is as bright as the
flowers of the haw-thorn.&nbsp; O how well didst thou succeed in
making me to languish, and despair.&nbsp; For heaven&rsquo;s
sake, pity my distressed condition, and soften the penance of thy
Bard.&nbsp; I am a Bard, who, though wounded by thee, sing thy
praises in well sounding verse, thou gentle maid of slender
shape, who hinderest me to sleep by thy charms.&nbsp; I bring thy
praises, bright maid, to thy neat palace at Dinbrain; <a
name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a> many are the songs that I rehearse to
celebrate thy beautiful form.</p>

18</span>AN ODE</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Of David Benvras</i>, <i>to Llewelyn the
Great</i>, <i>Prince of Wales</i>, <span
class="smcap"><i>a.d.</i></span> 1240.</p>
<p>He who created the glorious sun, and that cold pale luminary
the moon, grant that I attain the heights of poetry, and be
inspired with the genius of Myrddin; <a name="citation18a"></a><a
href="#footnote18a" class="citation">[18a]</a> that I may extol
the praise of heroes, like Aneurin, <a name="citation18b"></a><a
href="#footnote18b" class="citation">[18b]</a> in the day he sung
his celebrated Gododin; that I may set forth the happiness of the
inhabitants of Venedotia, the noble and prosperous prince of
Gwynedd, the stay and prop of his fair and pleasant
country.&nbsp; He is manly and heroic in the battle, his fame
overspreadeth the country about the mountain of Breiddin. <a
name="citation18c"></a><a href="#footnote18c"
class="citation">[18c]</a>&nbsp; Since God created the first man,
there never was his equal in the front of battle.&nbsp; Llewelyn
the generous, of the race of princes, has struck terror and
astonishment in the heart of kings.&nbsp; When he strove for
superiority with Loegria&rsquo;s king, when he was wasting the
country of Erbin, <a name="citation18d"></a><a
href="#footnote18d" class="citation">[18d]</a> his troops were
valiant and numerous.&nbsp; Great was the confusion when the
shout was given, his sword was bathed in blood; proud were his
nobles to see his army; when they heard the clashing of swords,
then was felt the agony of wounds <a name="citation18e"></a><a
href="#footnote18e" class="citation">[18e]</a> - - - - - <!--
page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>Many were the gashes in the conflict of war.&nbsp; Great
was the confusion of the Saxons about the ditch of Knocking. <a
name="citation19a"></a><a href="#footnote19a"
class="citation">[19a]</a>&nbsp; The sword was broke in the hand
of the warrior.&nbsp; Heads were covered with wounds, and the
flood of human gore gushed in streams down the knees.</p>
<p>Llewelyn&rsquo;s empire is wide extended, he is renowned as
far as Porth Ysgewin. <a name="citation19b"></a><a
href="#footnote19b" class="citation">[19b]</a>&nbsp; Constantine
was not his equal in undergoing hardships.&nbsp; Had I arrived to
the height of prophecy, and the great gift of ancient poesy, I
could not relate his prowess in action; no, Taliesin <a
name="citation19c"></a><a href="#footnote19c"
class="citation">[19c]</a> himself was unequal to the task.&nbsp;
Before he finishes his course in this world, after he has lived a
long life on earth, ere he goes to the deep and bone-bestrewed
grave, ere the green herb grows over his tomb, may He that turned
the water into wine, grant that he may have the Almighty&rsquo;s
protection, and that for every sin, with which he hath been
stained, he may receive remission.&nbsp; May Llewelyn, the noble
and generous, never be confounded or ashamed when he arrives at
that period; and may he be under the protection of the
saints.</p>

20</span>A POEM</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>To Llewelyn the Great</i>, <i>composed by
Einion the son of Gwgan</i>, <i>about</i> 1244.</p>
<p>I invoke the assistance of the God of Heaven, Christ our
Saviour, whom to neglect is impious.&nbsp; That gift is true
which descendeth from above.&nbsp; The gifts that are given me
are immortal, to discern, according to the great apostle, <i>what
is right and decent</i>; and, among other grand subjects, to
celebrate my prince, who avoids not the battle nor its danger;
Llewelyn the generous, the maintainer of Bards.&nbsp; He is the
dispenser of happiness to his subjects, his noble deeds cannot be
sufficiently extolled.&nbsp; His spear flashes in a hand
accustomed to martial deeds.&nbsp; It kills and puts its enemies
to flight by the palace of Rheidiol. <a name="citation20a"></a><a
href="#footnote20a" class="citation">[20a]</a>&nbsp; I have seen,
and it was my heart&rsquo;s delight, the guards of Lleision <a
name="citation20b"></a><a href="#footnote20b"
class="citation">[20b]</a> about its grand buildings; numberless
troops of warriors mounted on white steeds.&nbsp; They
encompassed our eagle: Llewelyn the magnanimous hero, whose
armour glistened; the maintainer of his rights.&nbsp; He defended
the borders of Powys, a country renowned for its bravery; he
defended its steep passes, and supported the privileges of its
prince.&nbsp; Obstinate was his resistance to the treacherous
English.&nbsp; In Rhuddlan he was like the ruddy fire flaming
with destructive light.&nbsp; There have I seen Llewelyn the
brave gaining immortal glory.&nbsp; I have seen him gallantly
ploughing the waves of Deva, when the tide was at its
height.&nbsp; I have seen <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>him furious
in the conflict of Chester, where he doubly repaid his enemies
the injuries he suffered from them.&nbsp; It is but just that he
should enjoy the praise due to his valour.&nbsp; I will extol
thee, and the task is delightful.&nbsp; Thou art like the eagle
amongst the nobles of Britain.&nbsp; Thy form is majestic and
terrible, when thou pursuest thy foes.&nbsp; When thou invadest
thy enemies, where Owain thy predecessor invaded them in former
times; full proud was thy heart in dividing the spoils, it
happened as in the battles of Kulwydd and Llwyvein. <a
name="citation21a"></a><a href="#footnote21a"
class="citation">[21a]</a>&nbsp; Thy beautiful steeds were
fatigued with the labour of the day, where the troops wallowed in
gore, and were thrown in confusion.&nbsp; The bow was full bent
before the mangled corse, the spear aimed at the breast in the
country of Eurgain. <a name="citation21b"></a><a
href="#footnote21b" class="citation">[21b]</a>&nbsp; The army at
Offa&rsquo;s Dike panted for glory, the troops of Venedotia, and
the men of London, were as the alternate motion of the waves on
the sea-shore, where the sea-mew screams; great was our happiness
to put the Normans to fear and consternation.&nbsp; Llewelyn the
terrible with his brave warriors effected it; the prince of
glorious and happy Mona.&nbsp; He is its ornament and
distinguished chief.</p>
<p>The lord of Demetia <a name="citation21c"></a><a
href="#footnote21c" class="citation">[21c]</a> mustered his
troops, and out of envy met his prince in the field.&nbsp; The
inhabitants of Stone-walled Carmarthen were hewn to pieces in the
conflict.&nbsp; Nor fort, nor castle, could withstand him: and
before the gates the English were trampled under foot.&nbsp; Its
chief was sad, the unsheathed sword shone bright, and hundreds of
hands were engaged in the onset at Llan <!-- page 22--><a

class="citation">[22b]</a> they purchased glory and honour . . .
In Aber Teivi the hovering crows were numberless . . . thick were
the spears besmeared with gore.&nbsp; The ravens croaked, they
were greedy to suck the prostrate carcases.&nbsp; Llewelyn, may
such fate attend thy foes.&nbsp; Mayest thou be more prosperous
than the noble Llywarch <a name="citation22c"></a><a
href="#footnote22c" class="citation">[22c]</a> with his bloody
lance.&nbsp; Thy glory shall not be obscured.&nbsp; There is none
that exceedeth thee in bestowing gifts on the days of
solemnity.&nbsp; In battle thy sword is conspicuous.&nbsp;
Wherever thou goest to war, to whatever distant clime, glory
follows thee from the rising to the setting sun.&nbsp; I have a
generous and noble prince, the lord of a large territory.&nbsp;
He is renowned for his coolness and conduct.&nbsp; Whole troops
fall before him; he defendeth his men like an eagle.&nbsp; My
prince&rsquo;s brave actions will be celebrated in the country by
Tanad. <a name="citation22d"></a><a href="#footnote22d"
class="citation">[22d]</a>&nbsp; He is valorous as a lion, who
can resist his lance?&nbsp; He is charitable to the needy, and
his relief is not sought in vain.&nbsp; My prince is dressed in
fine purple robes.&nbsp; He is like generous Nudd <a

class="citation">[22e]</a> in bestowing presents.&nbsp; Like
valiant Huail <a name="citation22f"></a><a href="#footnote22f"

Rhydderch <a name="citation22g"></a><a href="#footnote22g"
class="citation">[22g]</a> in distributing his gold.&nbsp; Let
his praise resound in every country.&nbsp; He possesses a large
territory and immense <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span

eyes.&nbsp; In wealth he is equal to Mordaf; like him he opens
his liberal hand to the Bard.&nbsp; He is like warlike Rhun <a

the subject of my meditation.&nbsp; I am to him as an hand or an
eye. <a name="citation23b"></a><a href="#footnote23b"
class="citation">[23b]</a>&nbsp; He is not descended from a base
degenerate stock; and I myself am descended from his
father&rsquo;s courtiers.&nbsp; His fury in battle is like
lightning when he attacks the foe: his heart glows with ardour in
the field like magnanimous Gwriad. <a name="citation23c"></a><a
href="#footnote23c" class="citation">[23c]</a> His enemies are
scattered as leaves on the side of hills drove by tempestuous
hurricanes.&nbsp; He is the honourable support and owner of
Hunydd. <a name="citation23d"></a><a href="#footnote23d"
class="citation">[23d]</a>&nbsp; He is the grace, the ornament of
Arvon. <a name="citation23e"></a><a href="#footnote23e"
class="citation">[23e]</a>&nbsp; Llewelyn, terror of thy enemy,
death issued out of thy hand in the South.&nbsp; Thou art to us
like an anchor in the time of storm.&nbsp; Protector of our
country, may the shield of God protect thee.&nbsp; Britain,
fearless of her enemies, glories in being ruled by him, by a
chief who has numerous troops to defend her; by Llewelyn, who
defies his enemies from shore to shore.&nbsp; He is the joy of
armies, and like a lion in danger.&nbsp; He is the emperor and
sovereign of sea and land.&nbsp; He is a warrior that may be
compared to a deluge, to the surge on the beach that covereth the
wild salmons.&nbsp; His noise is like the roaring wave that
rusheth to the shore, that can neither be stopped or
appeased.&nbsp; He puts numerous troops of his enemies to flight
like a mighty wind.&nbsp; Warriors crowded about him, zealous to
defend his just cause; their shields shone bright <!-- page
24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>on
their arms.&nbsp; His Bards make the vales resound with his
praises; the justice of his cause, and his bravery in maintaining
it, are deservedly celebrated.&nbsp; His valour is the theme of
every tongue.&nbsp; The glory of his victories is heard in
distant climes.&nbsp; His men exult about their eagle.&nbsp; To
yield or die is the fate of his enemies&mdash;they have
experienced his force by the shivering of his lance.&nbsp; In the
day of battle no danger can turn him from his purpose.&nbsp; He
is conspicuous above the rest, with a large, strong, crimson
lance.&nbsp; He is the honour of his country, great is his
generosity, and a suit is not made to him in vain.&nbsp; Llewelyn
is a tender-hearted prince.&nbsp; He can nobly spread the feast,
yet is he not enervated by luxury.&nbsp; May he that bestowed on
us a share of his heavenly revelation, grant him the blessed
habitation of the saints above the stars.</p>

<p>The spring returns, the trees are in their bloom, and the
forest in its beauty, the birds chaunt, the sea is smooth, the
gently-rising tide sounds hollow, the wind is still.&nbsp; The
best armour against misfortune is prayer.&nbsp; But I cannot hide
nor conceal my grief, nor can I be still and silent.&nbsp; I have
heard the waves raging furiously towards the confines of the land
of the sons of Beli. <a name="citation27b"></a><a

innocence and simplicity, joined with consummate prudence: she
was above the base arts of dissimulation.&nbsp; Now the ruddy
earth covers her in silence.&nbsp; How great was our grief, when
she was laid in her stony habitation.&nbsp; The burying of Nest
was an irreparable loss.&nbsp; Her eye was as sharp as the hawk,
which argued her descended from noble ancestors.&nbsp; She added
to her native beauty by her goodness and virtue.&nbsp; <!-- page

true friend, a descendant of Owain <a name="citation30b"></a><a

whose abilities appeared in his youth.&nbsp; He came to be a
leader of forces, dressed in blue, neat and handsome.&nbsp; In
the conflicts of battle, in the clang of arms, he was an heroic
youth.&nbsp; When ten years old he successfully attacked his
kinsman. <a name="citation30c"></a><a href="#footnote30c"

class="citation">[30d]</a> who was a bloody chief, like Julius
C&aelig;sar.&nbsp; A chief without blemish, not insulting his
foes in distress, but in war impetuous and fierce, like the
points of flaming fire burning in their rage.&nbsp; It is a
general loss to the Bards, that he is covered with earth.&nbsp;
We grieve for him.&mdash;Llewelyn was our prince ere the furious
contest happened, and the spoils were amassed with eagerness. <a

snow-white breasts of the warriors, and there was an universal
havoc and carnage after the shout.&nbsp; The parti-coloured waves
flowed over the broken spear, and the warriors were silent.&nbsp;
The briny wave came with force, and another met it mixed <!--

of the main over the great roaring of the floods.&nbsp; The spear
raged with relentless fury, and the tide of blood rushed with
force.&nbsp; Our attack was sudden and fierce.&nbsp; Death
displayed itself in all its horrors: so that it was a doubt
whether any of us should die of old age.&nbsp; Noble troops, in
the fatal hour, trampled on the dead like prancing steeds.&nbsp;
Before Rhodri was brought to submission, the church-yards were
like fallow grounds.&nbsp; When Llewelyn the successful prince
overcame near the Alun <a name="citation31a"></a><a

of the bright arms, ten thousand were killed, and the crows made

outrageous fire, yet he was a mild prince when the mead-horns
were distributed - - - - - - he gave generously under his waving
banners to his numerous Bards gold and silver, which he regardeth
not, and Gasgony prancing steeds, with rich trappings, and great
scarlet cloaks, shining like the ruddy flame: warlike, strong,
well-made destroying steeds, with streams of foam issuing out of
their mouths.&nbsp; He generously bestoweth, like brave Arthur,

when thy praises cease to be celebrated by the Bard and the harp,
my brave prince, ere thou comest, before thy last hour
approaches, to confess thy sins, after thou hast through thy
prowess vanquished thy enemies, mayest thou at last become a

matchless, his crimson lance is stained with gore.&nbsp; It is
natural to him to invade the lands of his enemies.&nbsp; He is
generous, the pillar of princes.&nbsp; I never return

<p>There is none equal to my prince with his numerous troops in
the conflict of war.&nbsp; He is a generous Cymro descended from
Beli Hir, <a name="citation37c"></a><a href="#footnote37c"

An heroic wolf from Eryri. <a name="citation37d"></a><a

among his nobles of matchless prowess; it is our duty to extol
him.&nbsp; He is clad in a golden vest in the army, and setteth
castles on fire.&nbsp; He is the bulwark of the battle with
Greidiawl&rsquo;s <a name="citation37e"></a><a

is a hero that with fury breaketh whole ranks, and fighteth

government and sovereign power; every prediction is at last to be

endless joys, and be reconciled to the Son of God, and enjoy
Heaven by his side.</p>
<h4>III.</h4>
<p>We have a prudent prince, his lance is crimson, his shield is
shivered to pieces; a prince furious in action, his palace is
open to his friends, but woe is the lot of his enemies.&nbsp;
Llewelyn the vanquisher of his adversaries is furious in battle
like an outrageous dragon; to be guarded against him availeth
not, when he cometh hand to hand to dispute the hardy
contest.&nbsp; May he that made him the happy governor of Gwynedd
and its towns, strengthen him for length of years to defend his
country from hostile invasion.&nbsp; It is our joy and happiness
that we have a brave warrior with prancing steeds, that we have a
noble Cymro, descended from Cambrian ancestors, to rule our
country and its borders.&nbsp; He is the best prince that the
Almighty made of the four elements.&nbsp; He is the <!-- page
39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>best
of governors, and the most generous.&nbsp; The eagle of Snowdon,
and the bulwark of battle.&nbsp; He pitched a battle where there
was a furious contest to obtain his patrimony on Cefn Gelorwydd;
<a name="citation39a"></a><a href="#footnote39a"
class="citation">[39a]</a> such a battle never happened since the
celebrated action of Arderydd. <a name="citation39b"></a><a
href="#footnote39b" class="citation">[39b]</a></p>
<p>He is the brave lion of Mona, the kind-hearted Venedotian, the
valiant supporter of his troops in Bryn Derwen.&nbsp; He did not
repent of the day in which he assaulted his adversaries: it was
like the assault of a hero descended from undaunted
ancestors.&nbsp; I saw a hero disputing with hosts of men like a
man of honour in avoiding disgrace.&nbsp; He that saw Llewelyn
like an ardent dragon in the conflict of Arfon and Eiddionydd, <a
name="citation39c"></a><a href="#footnote39c"
class="citation">[39c]</a> would have observed that it was a
difficult task to withstand his furious attack by Drws Daufynydd.
<a name="citation39d"></a><a href="#footnote39d"
class="citation">[39d]</a>&nbsp; No man has ever compelled him to
submit: may the Son of God never put him to confusion.</p>
<h4>IV.</h4>
<p>Like the roaring of a furious lion in the search of prey, is
thy thirst of praise, like the sound of a mighty hurricane over
the desert main, thou warlike prince of Aberffraw. <a
name="citation39e"></a><a href="#footnote39e"
class="citation">[39e]</a>&nbsp; Thy ravage is furious, thy
impetuosity irresistible, thy troops are enterprising in brave
actions, they are fierce and furious like a conflagration.&nbsp;
Thou art the <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>warlike prince of Dinefwr, <a
name="citation40a"></a><a href="#footnote40a"
class="citation">[40a]</a> the defence of thy people, the divider
of spoils.&nbsp; Thy forces are comely and neat, and of one
language.&nbsp; Thy proud Toledo sword is gilt with gold and its
edge broke in war.&nbsp; Thou prince of Mathrafal, <a
name="citation40b"></a><a href="#footnote40b"
class="citation">[40b]</a> extensive are the bounds of thy
dominions, thou rulest people of four languages.&nbsp; He staid
undaunted in battle against a foreign nation, and its strange
language.&nbsp; May the great King of heaven defend the just
cause of the warlike prince of the three provinces.</p>
<h4>V.</h4>
<p>I make my address to God, the source of praise, in the best
manner I am able, that I may extol with suitable words the chief
of men, who rageth like fire from the flashes of lightning, who
exchangeth thrusts with the burnished steel.&nbsp; I stand in
armour by the side of my prince with the red spear in the
conflict of war, he is a brave fighter, and the foremost in
action.&nbsp; Llewelyn, thy qualities are noble, I will valiantly
make my path broad with the edge of my sword.&nbsp; May the
prints of the hoofs of my prince&rsquo;s steeds be seen as far as
Cornwall.&nbsp; Numerous are the persons that congratulate him
upon this success, for he is a sure friend.&nbsp; The lion of
Gwynedd, and its extensive territories, the governor of the men
of Powys, and the South, who hath a general assembly of his armed
troops at Chester, who ravageth Lloegr to amass spoils.&nbsp; In
battle his success is certain, in killing, burning, and in
overthrowing castles.&nbsp; In Rhos, and Penfro, <a
name="citation40c"></a><a href="#footnote40c"
class="citation">[40c]</a> and in contests with the Normans, his
impetuosity prevaileth.&nbsp; The offspring of Griffydd, of
worthy <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>qualities, generous in distributing
rewards for songs.&nbsp; His shield shines, and the strong lances
quickly meet the streams of gushing gore.&nbsp; He extorteth
taxes from his enemies, and claimeth another country as a
sovereign prince.&nbsp; His noble birth is an ornament to
him.&nbsp; He besiegeth fortified towns, and his furious attacks
like those of Fflamddwyn <a name="citation41"></a><a
href="#footnote41" class="citation">[41]</a> reach far.&nbsp; He
is a prosperous chief with princely qualities, his Bards are
comely about his tables.&nbsp; I have seen him generously
distributing his wealth, and his mead-horns filled with generous
liquors.&nbsp; Long may he live to defend his borders with the
sharp sword, like Arthur with the lance of steel.&nbsp; May he
who is lawful king of Cymru, endued with princely qualities, have
his share of happiness at the right hand of God.</p>

42</span>A POEM</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Entitled the Ode of the Months</i>,
<i>composed by Gwilym Ddu of Arfon</i>, <i>to Sir John Griffydd
Llwyd</i>, <i>of Tregarnedd and Dinorwig</i>.</p>
<p>Why the Bard called this piece the &ldquo;Ode of the
Months&rdquo; I cannot guess; but by what he intimates in the
poem, which is that when all nature revives, and the whole animal
and vegetable creation are in their full bloom and vigour, he
mourned and pined for the decayed state of his country.&nbsp; The
hero he celebrates made a brave but successless attempt to rescue
it from slavery.&nbsp; It will not be amiss to give a short
account of the inhuman massacre of the Bards made by that cruel
tyrant Edward the first, which gave occasion to a very fine Ode
by Mr. Gray.&nbsp; Sir John Wynne, of Gwydir, a descendant in a
direct line from Owain Gwynedd, mentions this particular, and
says he searched all the records in the Exchequer at Carnarvon,
and in the Tower of London, for the antiquities of his country in
general, and of his own family in particular.&nbsp; I shall set
down his own words, as I find them in a very fair copy of that
history lent me by Sir Roger Mostyn, of Gloddaeth and Mostyn,
Bart., a person no less eminent for his generous communicative
temper, than for many other public and private virtues.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This is the most ancient song (i.e. one of
Rhys Goch of Eryri&rsquo;s, a Bard who flourished <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1400) I can find extant of my ancestors
since the reign of Edward the first, who caused our Bards all to
be hanged by martial law, as stirrers of the people to sedition;
whose example being followed by the governors of Wales until <!--
page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>Henry the Fourth&rsquo;s time, was the utter destruction
of that sort of men; and since then that kind of people were at
some further liberty to sing, and to keep pedigrees, as in
ancient time they were wont; since which time we have some light
of antiquity by their songs and writings,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following is taken from an old British grammar, written in
English, by William Salesbury, printed at London, 1567.&nbsp; I
have transcribed it faithfully according to the old
orthography.&nbsp; &ldquo;Howbeit when the whole Isle was
commonlye called Brytayne, the dwellers Brytons, and accordingly
their language Brytishe, I will not refell nor greatly deny;
neither can I justly gainsaye, but their tongue then was as
copious of syt woordes, and all manner of proper vocables, and as
well adornated with woorshipful sciences and honourable knowledge
as any other of the barbarous tongues were.&nbsp; And so still
continued (though their sceptre declined, and their kingdom
decayed, and they also by God&rsquo;s hand were driven into the
most unfertyl region, barenest country, and most desart province
of all the isle) untyll the conquest of Wales.&nbsp; For then, as
they say, the nobles and the greatest men beyng captives and
brought prysoners to the tower of London, there to remayne during
their lyves, desired of a common request, that they might have
with them all such bokes of their tongue, as they most delited
in, and so their petition was heard, and for the lightness soon
granted, and thus brought with them all the principallest and
chiefest books, as well of their own as of other their friends,
of whom they could obtain anye to serve for their purpose.&nbsp;
Whose mind was none other but to pass the time, and their
predestinate perpetual captivitie in the amenous varietie of over
reading and revoluting many volumes and sundry books of divers
sciences and strange matters.</p>
<p><!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>&ldquo;And that is the common answer of the Welshe
Bardes (for so they call their country poets) when a man shall
object or cast in their teeth the foolysh uncertainty and the
phantasticall vanities of their prophecies (which they call <span
class="smcap">Bruts</span>) or the doubtful race and kinde of
their uncanonized saynctes: whom that notwithstanding they both
invocate and worship wyth the most hyghe honoure and lowliest
reverence.&nbsp; Adding and allegying in excuse thereof, that the
reliques and residue of the books and monuments, as well as the
saynctes lyves, as of their Brutysh prophecies and other sciences
(which perished not in the tower, for there, they say, certain
were burned) at the commotion of <span class="smcap">Owain
Glyndwr</span>, were in like manner destroyed, and utterly
devastat, or at the least wyse that there escaped not one, that
was not uncurablye maymed, and irrecuperably torn and
mangled.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Llyfrau Cymru au llofrudd<br />

</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The books of Cymru and their remains went to the White
Tower, where they were hid.&nbsp; Cursed was Ysgolan&rsquo;s act
in throwing them in heaps into the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not improbable that our Bard might have been one of
those who suffered in the cause of his country, though he had the
good luck to escape Edward&rsquo;s fury.&nbsp; I wish I may be so
happy as to convey some faint idea of his merit to the English
reader.&nbsp; The original has such touches, as none but a person
in the Bard&rsquo;s condition could have expressed so
naturally.&nbsp; However not to anticipate the judicious
reader&rsquo;s opinion, to which I submit mine with all
deference, I shall now produce some account of this great man,
taken from that skilful <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>and candid antiquary Mr. Robert
Vaughan of Hengwrt&rsquo;s notes on Dr. Powel&rsquo;s history of
Wales, printed at Oxford, 1663.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir John Griffydd Llwyd, knight, the son of
Rhys ap Griffydd ap Ednyfed Fychan, was a valiant gentleman, but
unfortunate, &lsquo;magn&aelig; quidem, sed calamitos&aelig;
virtutis,&rsquo; as Lucius Florus saith of Sertorius.&nbsp; He
was knighted by king Edward, when he brought him the first news
of his queen&rsquo;s safe delivery of a son at Carnarvon Castle;
the king was then at Rhuddlan, at his parliament held
there.&nbsp; This Sir Griffydd afterwards taking notice of the
extreme oppression and tyranny exercised by the English officers,
especially Sir Roger Mortimer, lord of Chirk, and justice of
North Wales, towards his countrymen the Welsh, became so far
discontented, that he broke into open rebellion, verifying that
saying of Solomon, &lsquo;Oppression maketh a wise man
mad.&rsquo;&nbsp; He treated with Sir Edward Bruce, brother to
Robert, then king of Scotland, who had conquered Ireland, to
bring or send over men to assist him in his design against the
English; but Bruce&rsquo;s terms being conceived too
unreasonable, the treaty came to nought; however being desperate,
he gathered all the forces he could, and, in an instant, like a
candle that gives a sudden blaze before it is out, overran all
North Wales and the Marches, taking all the castles and holds;
but to little purpose, for soon after he was met with, his party
discomfited, and himself taken prisoner.&nbsp; This was in the
year of our Lord 1322.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought so much by way of introduction necessary to
commemorate so gallant a person; what became of him afterwards is
not mentioned by our historians.&nbsp; However the following poem
remains not only as a monument of the hero&rsquo;s bravery, but
of the Bard&rsquo;s genius.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>

grandeur, but now, alas! I am deprived of daily support, the time
is as disastrous as when our Saviour Christ was taken and
betrayed.&nbsp; How naked and forlorn is our condition!&nbsp; We
are exposed to anxious toils and cares.&nbsp; O how heavy is the
Almighty&rsquo;s punishment, that the crimson sword cannot be
drawn!&nbsp; I remember how great its size was, and how wide its
havoc; numerous are now the oppressed captives who languish in
gnashing indignation.&nbsp; Our native Bards are excluded from
their accustomed entertainments.&nbsp; How great a stop is put to
generosity since a munificent hero, like Nudd, <a

valorous hawk of Griffydd, <a name="citation46b"></a><a

ravaging and destroying his enemies, is deplored by the expert
Bards, who have lost their festivity and mirth in the place where
mead was drunk.&nbsp; I cannot bear to think of his injurious
treatment.&nbsp; His hospitality has fed thousands.&nbsp; He is,
alas! in a forlorn prison, such is the unjust oppression of the
land of the Angles. <a name="citation46c"></a><a

sorrow have overwhelmed me.&nbsp; I reckon not what becomes of
the affairs of this world.&nbsp; The Bards of two hundred regions
lament that they have now no protector.&nbsp; This is a certain,
but a sad truth.&nbsp; Though the unthinking vulgar do not
reflect as I do on the time when my eagle shone in his
majesty.&nbsp; I am pierced by the lance of despair.&nbsp; <!--

Long has the bright sword, that shone like a torch, been laid
aside, and the brave courage of the dauntless Achilles been
stopped.&nbsp; The whole pleasant season of May is spent in
dismal sorrow; and June is comfortless and cheerless.&nbsp; It
increaseth my tribulation, that Griffydd with the red lance is
not at liberty.&nbsp; I am covered with chilly damps.&nbsp; My
whole fabric shakes for the loss of my chief.&nbsp; I find no
intermission to my pain.&nbsp; May I sink, O Christ! my Saviour,
into the grave, where I can have repose; for now, alas! the
office of the Bard is but a vain and empty name.&nbsp; I am

50</span>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF TALIESIN,</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The Chief of Bards</i>, <i>and Elphin</i>,
<i>the son of Gwyddno Goranhir</i>, <i>his Patron</i>.</p>
<p>Gwyddno Goranhir, was a petty king of Cantre&rsquo;r Gwaelod,
whose country was drowned by the sea, in a great inundation that
happened about the year 560, through the carelessness of the
person into whose care the dams were committed, as appears from a
poem of Taliesin upon that sad catastrophe.&nbsp; In his time the
famous Taliesin lived, whose birth and education is thus related
in our ancient manuscripts.&nbsp; He was found exposed in a wear
belonging to Gwyddno, the profit of which he had granted to his
son, Prince Elphin, who being an extravagant youth, and not
finding the usual success, grew melancholy; and his fishermen
attributed his misfortune to his riotous irregular life.&nbsp;
When the prodigal Elphin was thus bewailing his misfortune, the
fishermen espied a coracle with a child in it, enwrapped in a
leathern bag, whom they brought to the young prince, who ordered
care to be taken of him, and when he grew up gave him the best
education, upon which he became the most celebrated Bard of his
time.&nbsp; The accomplished Taliesin was introduced by Elphin to
his father Gwyddno&rsquo;s court, where he delivered him a poem,
giving an account of himself, entitled, Hanes Taliesin, or
Taliesin&rsquo;s History; and at the same time another to his
patron and benefactor Elphin to console him upon his past
misfortune, and to exhort him to put his trust in Divine
Providence.&nbsp; This is a fine moral piece, and very artfully
addressed by the Bard, who introduces himself in the person and
character of an exposed infant.&nbsp; As it is probable that the
prince&rsquo;s affairs <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>took another turn since that period,
this was done with great propriety.&nbsp; Sir John Pryse mentions
the poem that Taliesin delivered to king Gwyddno, in his
Histori&aelig; Britannic&aelig; defensio.&nbsp; &ldquo;Taliesinus
quidem in odula, quam de suis erroribus composuit, sic inscripta
Britannic&egrave; (Hanes Taliesin) videlicet errores Taliesini,
ait se tandem divertisse ad reliquias Troj&aelig;;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mi a ddaethum yma at Weddillion
Troia;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;neque dubitandum est hoc fuesse opus Taliesini: nam
pr&aelig;ter innumeros codices vetustissimos, qui inscriptionem
hujusmodi attestentur, nullo reclamante, nullus est recentiorum
qui vel phrasin illius tam antiquam, carminisve majestatem
assequi potuit.&nbsp; Et ideo summus ille vates inter Britannos
censetur et nominatur.&rdquo;&nbsp; I never could procure a
perfect nor correct copy of this poem of Taliesin, otherwise I
would gratify the curious with a translation of it.&nbsp; It is
certain from his history, that he was a very learned man for his
time, and seems to have been well versed in the doctrine of the
Druids, particularly the
&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&epsilon;&mu;&psi;&#973;&chi;&omega;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;,
which accounts for the extravagant flights frequent in his
poems.&nbsp; I have now in my possession above fifty of them; but
they are so difficult to be understood, on account of their great
antiquity, and numerous obsolete words, and negligence of
transcribers, that it is too great a task for any man at this
distance of time to go about a translation of them.&nbsp; However
I have selected this ode, as a specimen of his manner of writing,
not as it is the best in the collection, but as it is the only
one I could thoroughly understand.&nbsp; There are many spurious
pieces fathered upon this Bard, in a great many hands in North
Wales; but these are all forged either by the monks, to answer
the purposes of the church of Rome, or by the British Bards, in
the time of the latter princes of Wales, to spirit up their
countrymen against the English, <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>which anybody
versed in the language may easily find by the style and
matter.&nbsp; It has been my luck to meet with a manuscript of
all his genuine pieces now extant, which was transcribed by the
learned Dr. Davies, of Mallwyd, from an old manuscript on vellum
of the great antiquary Mr. R. Vaughan, of Hengwrt.&nbsp; This
transcript I have shewn to the best antiquaries and critics in
the Welsh language now living.&nbsp; They all confess that they
do not understand above one half of any of his poems.&nbsp; The
famous Dr. Davies could not, as is plain from the many obsolete
words he has left without any interpretation in his
dictionary.&nbsp; This should be a caveat to the English reader
concerning the great antiquity of the poems that go under the
name of Ossian, the son of Fingal, lately published by Mr.
Macpherson.&nbsp; It is a great pity Taliesin is so obscure, for
there are many particulars in his poems that would throw great
light on the history, notions, and manners of the Ancient
Britons, especially of the Druids, a great part of whose learning
it is certain he had imbibed.&nbsp; This celebrated Bard was in
great favour with all the great men of his time, particularly
with Maelgwn Gwynedd, the warlike and victorious king of all
Britain, with Elphin his patron, whom he redeemed with his songs
from the castle of Tyganwy, where he was upon some account
confined by his uncle Maelgwn.&nbsp; He likewise celebrated the
victories of Urien Reged, king of Cumbria, and a great part of
Scotland, as far as the river Clyde.&nbsp; In short, he was held
in so great esteem by posterity, that the Bards mentioned him
with the greatest honour in their works.&nbsp; In his poem
entitled Anrheg Urien, or Urien&rsquo;s Present, he says that his
habitation was by Llyn Geirionnydd, in the parish of Llan
Rhychwyn, in Carnarvonshire, and mentions therein his
cotemporary, the famous Aneurin Gwawdrydd, author of the Gododin,
an heroic poem on the battle of Cattraeth, of which some account
is given in the Dissertatio de Bardis.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>A wn ni enw Aneurin Gwawdrydd
Awenydd<br />
A minnau Daliesin o lann Llyn Geirionnydd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i.e. I know the fame of that celebrated genius Aneurin
Gwawdrydd, who am Taliesin, whose habitation is by the pool
Geirionnydd.&mdash;</p>
<p>Having finished this short account of our author, I shall now
proceed to his poem, entitled, Dyhuddiant Elphin, or
Elphin&rsquo;s Consolation, which I offer now to the public.</p>
<p>Dr. John David Rhys quotes it at length in his Lingu&aelig;
Cymraec&aelig; Institutiones Accurat&aelig;; which, to save
further trouble, I shall beg leave to transcribe here in his own
words.&nbsp; &ldquo;C&aelig;terum nunc et propter eorum
authoritatem, et quod huic loco inter alia maxime quadrant, non
pigebit qu&aelig;dem antiquissima Taliesini Cambro-Britannica
Carmina subjungere,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>I have nothing more to acquaint the reader with, but that I
have used two copies in my translation, one in print by the said
Dr. John David Rhys, the other in manuscript by Dr. Thomas
Williams.&nbsp; I have followed the copy I thought most correct,
and have given the different reading of the manuscript in the
margin.</p>

54</span>TALIESIN&rsquo;S POEM</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>To Elphin</i>, <i>the son of Gwyddno
Goranhir</i>, <i>king of Cantre&rsquo;r Gwaelod</i>, <i>to
comfort him upon his ill success at the Wear</i>; <i>and to
exhort him to trust in Divine providence</i>.</p>
<h5>I.</h5>
<p>Fair Elphin, cease to weep, let no man be discontented with
his fortune; to despair avails nothing.&nbsp; It is not that
which man sees that supports him.&nbsp; Cynllo&rsquo;s prayer
will not be ineffectual.&nbsp; God will never break his
promise.&nbsp; There never was in Gwyddno&rsquo;s Wear such good
luck as to-night.</p>
<h5>II.</h5>
<p>Fair Elphin, wipe the tears from thy face!&nbsp; Pensive
melancholy will never profit thee; though thou thinkest thou hast
no gain; certainly too much sorrow will do thee no good; doubt
not of the great Creator&rsquo;s wonders; though I am but little,
yet am I endowed with great gifts.&nbsp; From the seas and
mountains, and from the bottom of rivers, God sends wealth to the
good and happy man.</p>
<h5>III.</h5>
<p>Elphin with the lovely qualities, thy behaviour is unmanly,
thou oughtest not to be over pensive.&nbsp; To trust in God is
better than to forebode evil.&nbsp; Though I am but small and
slender on the beach of the foaming main, I shall do thee more
good in the day of distress than three hundred salmons.</p>
<h5><!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>IV.</h5>
<p>Elphin with the noble qualities, murmur not at thy misfortune:
though I am but weak on my leathern couch, there dwelleth a gift
on my tongue.&nbsp; While I continue to be thy protection, thou
needest not fear any disaster.&nbsp; If thou desirest the
assistance of the ever blessed Trinity, nothing can do thee
hurt.</p>

59</span>DE BARDIS DISSERTATIO;</h3>
<p>Quum per multos annos non sine summa voluptate Bardos

<p>Bardi apud Celtas originem habuerunt; et Graeci, qui eorurn
meminerunt, mira omnino de illis produnt, quae eo magis fidem
merentur quod non solebant laudes suas in Barbaros effus&egrave;
impendere.&nbsp; Cum alibi gentium hodie nulla eorum maneant

Scriptoribus Graecis et Latinis elogii, qu&ograve; augustius in

<p>Pan welais fod un o <i>Ysgodogion Ucheldir Alban</i>, ac hefyd

i&rsquo;r <i>Saesoneg</i>, mi a dybygais mai nid gweddus i ni, y
<i>Cymry</i>, y rhai sydd genym Gerddi awduraidd, gorhenaidd,
o&rsquo;r einom, fod yn llwyr ddiymdro yn y cyngaws hwnnw: o
herwydd, hyd i gwn i, dyna&rsquo;r unig ragorgamp celfyddyd a
adawodd ein hynafiaid ini, sydd heb ei cholli.&nbsp; I mae

I mae ein hen <i>Fusic</i> wedi ei llwyr ebargofio: nid

dychymmygion diweddar, pan oedd y <i>Cymry</i> yn griddfan tan
iau galed y <i>Saeson</i>.&nbsp; Am gelfyddydau eraill, od oedd
dim mewn perffeithrwydd, i mae gwedi ei lwyr golli.&nbsp; Nid oes
genym ddim hanes am ein hynafiaid o&rsquo;n hawduron ein hunain,
ond oddiwrth y Beirdd yn unig, o flaen <i>Gildas ap Caw</i>; yr
hwn sydd yn ein goganu, ac yn ein llurginio, yn hytrach nag
ysgrifennu cywir hanes am danom; ond fo wyr hanesyddion yr achos:
heblaw hyn, i mae ei waith ef wedi myned drwy ddwylo&rsquo;r

gwedi gosod allan ddau lyfr o waith <i>Ossian</i>; hen Fardd,
meddai ef, cyn dyfod Cristianogaeth i&rsquo;w plith.&nbsp; Ac i
mae&rsquo;r llyfrau hyn mewn rhagorbarch gan foneddigion dysgedig
y <i>Saeson</i>.&nbsp; A rhaid addef eu bod wedi eu cyfieithu yn
odidog: ond i mae arnafi ofn, wedi&rsquo;r cwbl, fod yr
<i>Ysgodog</i> yn bwrw hug ar lygaid dynion, ac nad ydynt mor hen
ag i mae ef yn taeru eu bod.&nbsp; I mae&rsquo;r <i>Gwyddelod</i>
yn arddelw <i>Ossian</i> megis un o&rsquo;u cydwladwyr hwynt; ac
i mae amryw bethau yn y cerddi a gyhoeddwyd yn ei enw, yn dangos,
yn fy nhyb i, oes ddiweddarach nag i mae&rsquo;r cyfieithydd yn
son am dani; yn enwedig dyfodiad Gwyr <i>Llychlyn</i> i&rsquo;r
<i>Iwerddon</i>, yr hyn ni ddigwyddodd, meddai hanesyddion yr
<i>Iwerddon</i>, cyn y flwyddyn 700.&nbsp; Ac ni ddaeth yr
<i>Ysgodogion</i> chwaith i sefydlu yn yr <i>Alban</i>, o flaen
<i>Fergus Mac Ein</i>, ynghylch <!-- page 95--><a

503; fal i mae <i>William Llwyd</i>, Esgob <i>Caerwrangon</i>,
wedi ei brofi yn ddiwrthadl, yn ei lyfr ynghylch llywodraeth
eglwysig.&nbsp; Ond pei canniatteid eu bod hwy yno cyn hynny, ni
fyddai hynny ronyn nes i brofi <i>Ossian</i> mor hyned ag i
dywedir ei fod.&nbsp; O herwydd ped fuasai, pa fodd i mae ei
gyfieithydd yn medru ei ddeongli mor hyfedr?&nbsp; I mae gwaith
ein Beirdd ni, sydd gant o flynyddoedd ar ol hynny, tu hwnt i
ddeall y gwir cywreiniaf a medrusaf yn yr hen
<i>Frutaniaith</i>.&nbsp; Pwy o honom ni a gymerai&rsquo;r
<i>Gododin</i>, gwaith <i>Aneurin Gwawdrydd</i>, Fychdeyrn
Beirdd, a&rsquo;i gyfieithu mor llathraidd ag i gwnaeth
cyfieithydd <i>Ffingal</i> a <i>Themora</i>?&nbsp; Ir wyfi yn
meddwl nad oes neb a ryfygei gymmeryd y fath orchest arno.&nbsp;
Prin iawn i medreis i ddeongli rhai pennillion o hono yma a
thraw, y rhai a ellwch eu gweled yn y traethawd <i>Lladin</i>
ynghylch y Beirdd.&nbsp; A gresyn yw ei fod mor dywyll, o
herwydd, hyd ir wyf fi yn ei ddeall, gwaith godidog ydyw.&nbsp;
Yr un peth a ellir ei ddywedyd am <i>Daliesin</i> Ben Beirdd, nid
oes neb heddyw, hyd i gwn i, a fedr gyfieithu yn iawn un
o&rsquo;i Awdlau na&rsquo;i Orchanau.&nbsp; Myfi a wn fod amryw
Frudiau ar hyd y wlad, wedi eu tadogi ar <i>Daliesin</i> a
<i>Myrddyn</i>; ond nid ydynt ond dychymygion diweddar, gwedi eu
ffurfeiddio ar ol marwolaeth <i>Llywelyn ap Gruffydd</i>.&nbsp;
Yn enwedig yn amseroedd terfysglyd <i>Owain Glyndwr</i>,
a&rsquo;r ymdrech rhwyg pleidiau <i>Efrog</i> a
<i>Lancaster</i>.&nbsp; I mae hefyd eraill, gwedi eu lluniaethu
gan y Meneich, i atteb eu dibenion hwythau; ond i mae&rsquo;r
rhain oll yn hawdd eu gwahanu oddiwrth awduraidd waith
<i>Taliesin</i>, wrth yr iaith.&mdash;I mae yn ddiammau genyf,
fod y bardd yma yn odidog yn ei amser.&nbsp; Ir oedd yn
gydnabyddus ag athrawiaith y <i>Derwyddon</i> am y
&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&epsilon;&mu;&psi;&#973;&chi;&omega;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;,
a&rsquo;r Daroganau, y rhai oeddynt yn ddiammau, weddillion
o&rsquo;r Credo paganaidd; canys nid yw daroganu ddim arall ond
mynegi pethau i ddyfod, oddiwrth y <i>Ddar</i>, yr hon ir oeddynt
y <i>Derwyddon</i> yn ei pherchi yn fawr iawn.&nbsp; A chan ei

a&rsquo;i roesawu gan y gwerinos, megis ped fuasai wir
broffwyd.&nbsp; A hynny a ellir ei ddywedyd hefyd am Ferddin
Emrys, a&rsquo;i broffwydoliaeth.&nbsp; Mor anhawdd yw tynnu
ofergoelion eu hynafiaid, oddiwrth un wlad neu genedl!</p>
<p>E ddichon rhai o honoch ysgatfydd ofyn, Paham na buaswn yn
cyfieithu rhai o&rsquo;r Beirdd godidog diweddar, a ysgrifenasant
wedi diwygio yr hen gynghanedd?&nbsp; I&rsquo;r rhain ir wyf yn
ateb, fod y Beirdd yn amser y tywysogion yn fwy ardderchog a
mawryddig yn eu gwaith; ac ir oeddynt eu hunain, rai o naddunt,
yn dywysogion, ac yn wyr dyledogion; yn enwedig, <i>Owain
Cyfeiliog</i>, tywysog <i>Powys</i>; a <i>Hywel ap Owain
Gwynedd</i>, Bardd a rhyfelwr godidog: ac felly ir oeddynt yn fwy
penigamp na&rsquo;r Beirdd diweddar, o ran eu testunau.&nbsp;
Canys ir oedd y Beirdd diweddar, fel i mae <i>Sion Dafydd
Rhys</i> yn achwyn arnynt, yn gwenieithio i&rsquo;r gwyr mawr, ac
yn dywedyd celwydd ar eu c&acirc;n; ac yn haeru iddynt dorri
cestyll, lladd a llosgi, pryd ir oeddynt, eb ef, yn cysgu yn eu
gwelyau, heb ddim mo&rsquo;r fath feddwl nac amcan
ganddynt.&nbsp; Eithr yn amser y tywysogion, o&rsquo;r
gwrthwyneb, ir oedd y Beirdd yn dystion o ddewredd a
mawrfrydigrwydd eu tywysogion; ac ir oeddynt eu hunain yn filwyr
glewion.&nbsp; Ir oedd <i>Meilir Brydydd</i> yn gennad dros
<i>Ruffydd ap Cynan</i> at frenin <i>Lloegr</i>; ac ir oedd
<i>Gwalchmai</i>, ei fab, yn flaenor c&acirc;d ynghyffinydd
<i>Lloegr</i> a <i>Chymru</i>; fel i maent ill dau yn
tystiolaethu yn eu cerddi.&nbsp; Heblaw hyn, ir oedd y tywysogion
yma yn fuddugawl yn eu rhyfeloedd &acirc;&rsquo;r <i>Saeson</i>,
ac ir oedd hynny yn peri i&rsquo;r Beirdd ymorchestu, i
dragywyddoli eu gweithredoedd ardderchog; ac i foli eu gwroldeb
mewn achos mor glodfawr ag amddiffyn eu gwlad a&rsquo;u rhyddid,
yn erbyn estron genedl, a&rsquo;u difuddiasei o dreftadaeth eu
hynafiaid.&nbsp; Ir oedd y rhain yn ddiau yn destunau gwiw i
Feirdd ganu arnynt, ac yn fodd cymmwys i beri i&rsquo;w deiliaid
eu perchi a&rsquo;u hanrhydeddu; canys ir oedd y cerddi <!-- page

cyweiriau cyfaddas, mewn gwleddau yn llys y tywysog, ac yn
neuaddau y pendefigion a&rsquo;r uchelwyr.&nbsp; I mae
<i>Giraldus</i> yn dywedyd, fod y <i>Cymry</i> mor ddrud a
milwraidd yn ei amser ef, ag na rusynt ymladd yn noeth ac yn
ddiarfog, &acirc;&rsquo;r rhai arfog, llurugog; a&rsquo;r pedydd
yn erbyn y marchogion.&nbsp; Yn ddiau nid oedd un modd a ellid ei
ddychymmygu well, i gynnal yr yspryd dihafarch yma yn ein
hynafiaid, na chael eu moli gan y Beirdd.&nbsp; Ac e
wyddai&rsquo;r <i>Saeson</i> hynny yn dda ddigon; canys ar ol
darostwng <i>Cymru</i> tan eu llywodraeth, e ddarfu iddynt
ddihenyddu&rsquo;r Beirdd trwy&rsquo;r holl wlad.&nbsp; I mae
llyfrau ystatud Lloegr, yn llawn o gyfreithiau creulon i&rsquo;w
herbyn, ac yn gwarafun yn gaeth iddynt ymarfer o&rsquo;u hen
ddefodau, o glera a chymhortha.&nbsp; Yn amser <i>Owain
Glyndwr</i>, i cawsant ychydig seibiant a chynhwysiad i ganu; ond
gwedi hynny, hyd ddyfodiad <i>Harri&rsquo;r Seithfed</i>, ir
oeddynt tan gwmmwl.&nbsp; Gwedi iddo ef ddyfod i lywodraethu, ac
yn amser ei fab, <i>Harri&rsquo;r Wythfed</i>, a&rsquo;r
frenhines <i>Elisabeth</i>, y rhai a hanoeddynt o waed Cymreig, i
cawsant gynhwysiadau i gynnal Eisteddfodau: ond ni pharhaodd
hynny ond ennyd fechan, o herwydd bonedd Cymru a ymroisant i fod
yn Saeson, fel i maent yn parhau gan mwyaf hyd y dydd heddyw.</p>
<p>Ond i mae rhai yn yr oes yma yn chwenychu eu cadw a&rsquo;u
coledd, er mwyn eu hiaith ddigymmysg, ac er mwyn gwell gwybodaeth
o foesau ac ansawdd ein hynafiaid; ac er mwyn eu teilyngdod eu
hunain; o herwydd i mae yn rhai o&rsquo;u Hawdlau a&rsquo;u
Cywyddau, ymadroddion mor gywraint a naturiol ag sydd ym
Mhrydyddion Groeg a Rhufain; mal i gwyr y sawl a&rsquo;u deallant

<p>1.&nbsp; A method how to retrieve the ancient British
language, in order that the Bards of the sixth century may be
understood, and that the genuineness of Tyssilio&rsquo;s British
History, which was translated from the Armoric language into
Latin by Galfridus Arturius of Monmouth may be decided; and
concerning a new edition of Gildas Nennius&rsquo;s Eulogium
Brittanni&aelig;, with notes, from ancient British MSS.&nbsp;
This old British writer has been shamefully mangled by Dr. Gale,
his editor, in the Scriptores Brittannici; and not much mended by
Mr. Bertram in his late edition of it at Copenhagen.</p>
<p>Whether the ancient British language can be so far recovered
as to understand the most ancient British writings now extant,
is, I think, a consideration by no means beneath the notice of a
society of Antiquarians, and of all learned men in general.&nbsp;
There has been, it is true, an attempt of this nature made by the
very learned Mr. Edward Llwyd, of the Museum, and in part
laudably executed in his Arch&aelig;ologia Britannica, which
reflects honour on those worthy persons who supported him in his
five years travels into Ireland, Scotland, Cornwal, Basse
Bretagne, and Wales.&nbsp; But as his plan was too extensive to
bring every branch of what he undertook to perfection, I think a
continuation of the same, restrained within certain limits, might
still be useful.&mdash;Natural history is itself a province
sufficient to engross a man&rsquo;s whole attention; but it was
only a part of this great man&rsquo;s undertaking: and the
learned world is abundantly convinced of the uncommon proficiency
he made in natural philosophy; and how industrious he was in
tracing the dialects of the ancient Celtic language.&nbsp; But
still it must be acknowledged that he did very little towards the
thorough understanding the ancient British Bards and
historians.&nbsp; And indeed he owns himself that he was not
encouraged in this part of his intended work, as appears by his
proposals.&nbsp; Far be it from me to censure those very learned
men who generously contributed to support the ingenious author in
his travels, and dictated the method he was to persue.&nbsp; But,
after all, I cannot help lamenting that he did not pay more
attention to the old MSS. and compile a glossary to understand
them.&nbsp; What he has done of this nature is very imperfect,
few words being added to what there are in Dr. Davies&rsquo;s
Dictionary, and those chiefly from writings of the fourteenth and
fifteenth century.&nbsp; Indeed it appears he had not seen the
works but of one of the Bards of the sixth century, and that in
the red book of Hergest, in the Archives of Jesus&rsquo;s
College, Oxon.&nbsp; He complains <!-- page 134--><a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>he could
not procure access to the collections at Hengwrt and Llan Fordaf,
and without perusing those venerable remains, and leisure to
collate them with other copies, it was impossible for him to do
anything effectual.&mdash;Now the method I would propose to a
person that would carry this project into execution, is, that as
soon as he is become master of the ancient British language, as
far as it can be learned, by the assistance of Dr. Davies&rsquo;s
dictionary, and Moses Williams&rsquo;s glossary at the end of Dr.
Wotton&rsquo;s translation of Howel Dda&rsquo;s laws, he should
endeavour to procure access to the great collections of ancient
British MSS. in the libraries of the Earl of Macclesfield, Lady
Wynne of Wynstay, the Duke of Ancaster, Sir Roger Mostyn at
Gloddaith, John Davies, Esquire, at Llannerch, Miss Wynne of Bod
Yscallen, William Vaughan, Esquire, at Cors y Gedol, and in other
places both in South and North Wales in private hands.&nbsp; By
this means he would be enabled in time to ascertain the true
reading in many MSS. that have been altered and mangled by the
ignorance of transcribers.&nbsp; I am satisfied there are not
many copies of the Bards of the sixth century extant, nor indeed
of those from the conquest to the death of Llewelyn.&nbsp; But
two or three ancient copies on vellom, if such can be met with,
will be sufficient; for in some transcripts by good hands that I
have seen, they are imperfect in some copies.&nbsp; This would in
a great measure enable our traveller to fill up the blanks, and
help him to understand what, for want of this, must remain
obscure, if not altogether unintelligible.&nbsp; We should by the
means of such a person have a great many monuments of genius
brought to light, that are now mouldering away with age, and a
great many passages in history illustrated and confirmed that are
now dark and dubious.&nbsp; Whole poems of great length and merit
might be retrieved, not inferior, perhaps, to Ossian&rsquo;s
productions, if indeed those extraordinary poems are of so
ancient date, as his translator avers them to be.&nbsp; The
Gododin of Aneurin Gwawdrydd is a noble heroic poem.&nbsp; So are
likewise the works of Llywarch Hen about his battles with the
Saxons, in which he lost twenty-four sons, who all were
distinguished for their bravery with golden
torques&rsquo;s.&nbsp; <i>Aurdorchogion</i>.</p>
<p>Taliesin&rsquo;s poems to Maelgwn Gwynedd, to Elphin ap
Gwyddno, to Gwynn ap Nudd, and Urien Reged, and other great
personages of his time, are great curiosities.&nbsp; We have,
besides these, some remains of the works of Merddin ap Morfryn,
to his patron Gwenddolau ap Ceidis, and of Afan Ferddig to
Cadwallon ap Cadfan; and, perhaps, there may be in those
collections some besides that we have not heard of.&nbsp; All
these treasures might be brought to light, by a person well
qualified for the undertaking, properly recommended by men of
character and learning: and I think, in an age wherein all parts
of literature are cultivated, it would be a pity to lose the few
remaining monuments now left of the ancient British Bards, some
of <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>which are by their very antiquity become
venerable.&nbsp; Aneurin Gwawdrydd above-mentioned is said, by
Mr. Robert Vaughan of Hengwrt, to be brother to Gildas ap Caw,
author of the <i>Epistle de excidio Britanni&aelig;</i> which is
the most ancient account of Great Britain extant in Latin by a
native.&mdash;No manner of estimate can be made of the works of
our Bards and Historians that have been destroyed from time to
time; nay some very curious ones have been lost within this
century and a half.&nbsp; I think, therefore, it would be an act
becoming the Antiquarian Society, and all patrons of learning in
general, to encourage and support such an undertaking, which
would redound much to their honour, and be a fund of a rational
and instructive amusement.&mdash;Nor would those benefits alone
accrue from a thorough knowledge of our Bards, but still more
solid and substantial ones.&nbsp; For who would be better
qualified than such a person to decide the controversy about the
genuineness of the British History, by Tyssilio, from the oldest
copies of it now extant, which differ in a great many particulars
from the Latin translation of Galfrid, who owns that he received
his copy from a person who brought it from Armorica; and why may
there not be some copies of it still behind in some monasteries
of that country, and of other works still more valuable?&nbsp;
Mr. Llwyd, of the Museum, intended to visit them all, in order to
get a catalogue of them to be printed in his Arch&aelig;ologia
Britannica; but he was prevented by the war which then broke out,
of which he gives an account in a letter to Mr. Rowlands, author
of Mona Antiqua restaurata, and which is published at the end of
that treatise.&nbsp; Who can be better qualified to succeed in
such an undertaking than a person that is thoroughly well versed
in all the old MSS. now extant in Wales.&nbsp; I find that the
Armoric historians, particularly Father Lobineau, quote some of
their ancient Bards to confirm historical facts.&nbsp; This is
demonstration that some of their oldest Bards are still extant;
and who knows but that some of the books they took with them when
they first went to settle in Gaul, under Maximus and Conau
Meiriadoc, may be still extant, at least transcripts of some of
them; for that some were carried over is plain, by what Gildas
himself says, &ldquo;qu&aelig; vel si qua fuerint, aut ignibus
hostium exusta, aut civium exulum classe longins deportata non
compareant.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that I would have our traveller pass
two years at least in Basse Bretagne, in order to make enquiry
after such ancient monuments, and I make no doubt but he would
make great discoveries.&mdash;Thus furnished, he might proceed to
the British Museum, the Bodleian library, and the library of the
two Universities, and elsewhere, where any ancient British MSS.
are preserved.&nbsp; We might then have better editions of
British authors than we have had from the English antiquaries,
though in other respects very learned men; but, being
unacquainted with our language, Bards, and antiquities, they have
nothing but bare conjectures, and some scraps from the Roman
writers to produce.&nbsp; No one <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>likewise
would be better qualified to fix the ancient Roman stations in
Britain, as they are set down in Antoninus&rsquo;s intinerary,
and their ancient British names.&mdash;I wish learned men would
think of this ere it be too late; for one century makes a great
havoc of old MSS. especially such as are in the hands of private
persons, who understand not their true value, or are suffered to
rot in such libraries, where nobody is permitted to have access
to them.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 141</span>A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF THE
AUTHOR<br />
Of the preceding Work.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;In the church-yard of Llanfihangel Lledrod, situated at
some distance from Crosswood, on the other side of Ystwyth, are
deposited, without stone or epitaph, the remains of the Rev. Evan
Evans, the author of &lsquo;Specimens of the Poetry of the
Ancient Welsh Bards,&rsquo; &amp;c., and equally distinguished
for his genius as a poet, and his knowledge of the British
language and antiquities.&nbsp; He was born at Cynhawdref in this
parish, about the year 1730, and received the first part of his
education at the Grammar School at Ystrad Meirig, then under the
care of the celebrated Mr. Richards.&nbsp; Hence he removed to
Jesus College, Oxford, towards the beginning of 1751.&nbsp; He
afterwards took orders, and served successively several churches
in the capacity of curate, but was never fortunate enough to hold
a living of his own.&nbsp; His disappointment in his profession
preyed considerably on his mind, and led him to seek an oblivion
to his vexation in excesses which impaired his health and greatly
limited his usefulness.&nbsp; He devoted considerable attention
in early life to the study of his native language, in which he
composed several poetical pieces.&nbsp; Some of these, as appears
from a correspondence inserted in the &lsquo;Cambrian
Register,&rsquo; were submitted to the criticism, and received
the corrections of Mr. Lewis Morris, who speaks highly of Mr.
Evans&rsquo;s talents and promise of future excellence.&nbsp; His
chief literary productions are the &lsquo;Specimens,&rsquo; above
mentioned, which were published in 4to. in 1764.&nbsp; In these
he has given a literal prose version of the writings of some of
the earlier Welsh bards.&nbsp; For the copy-right he received
thirty pounds.&nbsp; He wrote also several English poems, and a
great number of short poems in Welsh, (some of which are inserted
in the following pages,) and a translation into Welsh of two
volumes of sermons, selected out of Tillotson and other eminent
divines.&nbsp; A great part of his life was spent in collecting
and transcribing ancient Welsh manuscripts.&nbsp; He was admitted
to the collection of Sir Roger Mostyn, which preserves a very
great number of ancient manuscripts, of great value: he likewise
copied the works of the oldest bards, from a very large vellum
manuscript, called &lsquo;Y Llyfr Coch,&rsquo; in the library of
Jesus College, Oxford.&nbsp; He thence also copied several
valuable historical tracts of the 12th century.&nbsp; He, besides
what has been mentioned, explored every corner of Wales, in quest
of manuscripts, and met with considerable success; but the
neccessary encouragement, which was solicited towards putting a
part of what he had thus collected to press was withheld from
him.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Partly extracted from Rees&rsquo;s
Historical description of South Wales</i>.</p>
<p>We are told that the ancient Welsh MSS. which our industrious
author collected and transcribed, occupy upwards of eighty
volumes.&nbsp; They were purchased by the late Paul Panton Esq.,
of Plasgwyn, Anglesea.</p>
<p>Mr. Evans had a lengthy correspondence with Bishop Percy and
other eminent antiquaries; the most interesting portions of which
will be found in the following pages together with selections
from his poetical works.&nbsp; He was of tall
stature,&mdash;hence his Bardic name of Prydydd Hir, (the tall
poet.)&nbsp; He was very benevolently disposed, and highly
national and patriotic, and as might be expected, was most averse
to the appointment of English prelates to Welsh dioceses.&nbsp;
That will partly account for his stationary position in the
Establishment.&nbsp; His excessive love of the &lsquo;wine
cup&rsquo; may also have had something to do in preventing his
appointment to a more lucrative position in the Church.&nbsp; Mr
Evans died suddenly in the month of May 1789; some say that he
perished on a mountain; <i>others</i> say that he died at, or
near his native home; but <i>none</i> deny that poverty and
sorrow hastened the death of our talented but unfortunate
author.</p>

He pined and sighed his soul away.<br />
Ungrateful countrymen, your pride,<br />

class="pagenum">p. 146</span>THE PENITENT SHEPHERD.</h4>
<p class="poetry">A pensive Shepherd, on a summer&rsquo;s day,<br
/>
Unto a neighb&rsquo;ring mountain bent his way,<br />
And solitary mus&rsquo;d, with thoughts profound,<br />
Whilst ev&rsquo;ry thing was silent all around;<br />
The firmament was clear, the sky serene,<br />
And not a cloud eclips&rsquo;d the rural scene.<br />
Not so the Shepherd, all was storm within,<br />
He mourn&rsquo;d his frailty, and bewail&rsquo;d his sin;<br />
His soul alone engross&rsquo;d his utmost care,<br />
Decoy&rsquo;d by cursed Satan to his snare;<br />
(Alas! with what success he tempts mankind,<br />
And leads them to their ruin with the blind!)<br />
Awhile he stood, as one in woeful pain;<br />
At last, he broke in melancholy strain,<br />
And cried,&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;O great Creator, ever
good and wise,<br />
I dare not lift to thee mine eyes&mdash;<br />
Thy violated laws for vengeance call,<br />
And on offenders heavy judgment fall;<br />
Which hurl them flaming to eternal pains,<br />
To suffer ever on infernal plains.<br />
The terrors of thy justice make me fear,<br />
For who can everlasting torment bear?<br />
My soul with grief is rent, Oh! stop thy hand,<br />
Shivering before thy Majesty I stand;<br />
Long have I trod the &rsquo;luring path of vice,<br />
And tire thy patience, and thy grace despise.<br />
Before thy throne I bow with suppliant knee,<br />
Grant gracious God, thy pardon unto me:<br />
In solitude my follies I repent,<br />
The life so long, so viciously, I spent,<br />
<!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>O God! I wish undone my wicked deeds,<br />
My contrite heart with inward sorrows bleeds.<br />
Thou, O my God! art witness of my grief,<br />
And thou alone canst grant me a relief.<br />
I promise faithfully to sin no more,<br />
(I sue for mercy, and thy grace implore,)<br />
And spend my life, for ever, in thy fear,<br />
Thy laws to keep, thy holy name revere.&rdquo;<br />
Thus plain&rsquo;d the pensive Shepherd, and his moan,<br />
Christ, his Mediator, brought before the throne!<br />
Him graciously answer&rsquo;d God to Sire,<br />
His face resplendent with a globe of fire:&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;My Son hath paid thy ransom, go in peace,<br />
Eternal justice bids thee be at ease!&rdquo;<br />
He said, and all the choir of angels sung,<br />
Harmonious melody, their harps they strung,<br />
And heaven&rsquo;s Empyreum to their music rung,<br />
Such is the joy when a poor sinner turns,<br />
That with uncommon glow each seraph burns.<br />
Thus I may compare small things with great,<br />
The Prodigal his tender father met;<br />
Such as the Gospel paints in tatter&rsquo;d weed,<br />
Willing with husks to satisfy his need:<br />
And none would give them, though the hungry roam,<br />
Till he returned unto his Father&rsquo;s home;<br />
Who kill&rsquo;d the fatted calf, and spread the feast,<br />
Where wine and minstrelsy his joy exprest.<br />
The Shepherd thus refresh&rsquo;d with heavenly grace,<br />
Return&rsquo;d with joy eternal in his face;<br />
The Saviour&rsquo;s wond&rsquo;rous love to man he
prais&rsquo;d,<br />
And thus his voice with gratitude he rais&rsquo;d:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;All glory to the
gracious <span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span
class="smcap">God</span>,<br />
Who hast alone the grevious wine-press trod,<br />
To satisfy his justice, and for me<br />
Hast wrought endless salvation on the tree;<br />
<!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>Who hast redeem&rsquo;d us, and destroyed our foes,<br
/>
That neither death nor grave can work our woes:<br />
Hast overthrown the dragon, and no more<br />
Hell, nor its gates have terrors left in store!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus did the Shepherd testify
his joy,<br />
A theme that might an angel&rsquo;s tongue employ;<br />
He praised Christ, who for mankind did die;<br />
His praise let all resound, to all eternity.</p>

<p>I cannot sufficiently acknowledge Sir Thomas Mostyn&rsquo;s
kindness, in the trouble he has taken, of sending up the
catalogue of his historical MSS. and in his obliging offer of
communicating them to me.&nbsp; Those which I am desirous to see
more than the rest, are these, viz.&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Annals of the Abbey of Chester, to <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1297.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beda de Gestis Anglorum, if it be a different work from
his Chronicon and Ecclesiastical History.&nbsp; It is the
same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;History of England, from William the Conqueror to the
6th of Edward the 6th.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annales Cambri&aelig; ignoti autoris, et Chronica
Cambri&aelig;; both which seem to be in the same volume, which
begins with a Welsh history of the Kings of the Britons and
Saxons, and Princes of Wales, to the time of Edward 4th.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A chronology from Vortigern downwards, supposed to be
collected by Robert Vaughan, of Hengwrt, Esquire, which seems to
be in the volume beginning with Sir John Wynne&rsquo;s pedigree
of the family of Gwydir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treatises concerning the courts of wards and
chancery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Sir Thomas proposes to come to town soon, I hope he will be
so good as to bring those MSS. with him (as Sir W. W. Wynne will
several others, that he has found at Llanvorda) because they will
be very useful to me as I conceive, for my first volume.</p>
<p>There are some others I should be glad to look over, but shall
have more time for it.&nbsp; Were I on the spot, I should be very
curious to consult the MS. of Froissart, though that
author&rsquo;s history, so favourable to the English, is
printed.&nbsp; My edition of it is that of Paris, 1520, which I
take to be the last of any: but there is a MS. finely wrote and
illuminated of this author, in the monastery called Elizabeth, at
Breslaw, in Silesia, which contains a third part more than any
printed edition.&nbsp; Count Bicklar, a Silesian nobleman, who
was at Paris, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1727, promised me
to get a printed edition of Froissart collated with that MS. but
he could find no monk in the monastery, or any about the place,
capable of doing it.&nbsp; I desired him to buy a MS. that
seemeth useless to the convent, at the price of 200 ducats, but
my offer made them fancy it the more valuable, and they would not
sell it.&nbsp; I have seen a MS. in the king&rsquo;s library at
Paris, and that of the capuchins at Rouen, but they contained no
more than my edition: I should be glad to know if Sir
Thomas&rsquo;s does.&nbsp; I gave the Benedictine, who has the
care of the new collections of French historians, notice of the
MS. at Breslaw, that he might make use of it in his new edition
of Froissart; but I have not heard whether he has got the MS.
collated, and the supplement copied.</p>
<p>Adredus Rievallensis, Robert of Gloucester, Caradoc of
Llancarvan, and Geoffry of Monmouth, are printed; and I have
examined several MSS. of the case in the Cotton, Oxford and
Cambridge libraries; so are the MSS. of Giraldus Cambrensis; but
if Sir Thomas&rsquo;s MSS. contain more than the printed
editions, I shall be extremely glad to see them, as also
Trussel&rsquo;s original of cities, and antiquities of
Westminster, as also the digression left out of Milton&rsquo;s
history.&nbsp; The tracts of state in the times of Elizabeth,
James I., and Charles I.&nbsp; I shall be very glad to see: but
they, as well as some others, I can the better stay for, because
they relate to more modern times.</p>
<p>Pray make my humble service and acknowledgments acceptable to
Sir Thomas; which will oblige me to be more, if possible, than I
am,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Dear Sir,</p>

<h4><!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>Mr. Lewis Morris to the Rev. Evan
Evans.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Bard</span>,</p>
<p>I received your&rsquo;s last post, without date, with a
<i>Cowydd Merch</i>, for which I am very much obliged to
you.&nbsp; I cannot see why you should be afraid of that subject
being the favourite of your <i>Awen</i>.&nbsp; It is the most
copious subject under heaven, and takes in all others; and, for a
fruitful fancy, is certainly the best field to play in, during
the poet&rsquo;s tender years.&nbsp; Descriptions of wars,
strife, and the blustering part of man&rsquo;s life, require the
greatest ripeness of understanding, and knowledge of the world;
and is not to be undertaken but by strong and solid heads, after
all the experience they can come at.</p>
<p>Is it not odd, that you will find no mention made of
<i>Venus</i> and <i>Cupid</i> amongst our Britons, though they
were very well acquainted with the Roman and Greek writers?&nbsp;
That god and his mother are implements that modern poets can
hardly write a love-poem without them: but the Britons scorned
such poor machines.&nbsp; They have their <i>Essyllt</i>,
<i>Nyf</i>, <i>Enid</i>, <i>Bronwen</i>, <i>Dwynwen</i>, of their
own nation, which excelled all the Roman and Greek
goddesses.&mdash;I am now, at my leisure hours, collecting the
names of these famous men and women, mentioned by our poets, (as
Mr. Edward Llwyd once intended,) with a short history of them; as
we have in our common Latin dictionaries, of those of the Romans
and Grecians.&nbsp; And I find great pleasure in comparing the
<i>Triades</i>, <i>Beddau</i>, <i>Milwyr Ynys Prydain</i>, and
other old records, with the poets of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries; which is the time when our Britons wrote most and
best.</p>
<p>Let me have a short <i>Cowydd</i> from you now and then; and I
will send you my observations upon them, which may be of no
disservice to you.&nbsp; That sent in your last letter, I here
return to you; with a few corrections.&nbsp; It doth not want
many: use them, or throw them in the fire, which you
please.&nbsp; Do not swallow them without examination.&nbsp; The
authority of good poets must determine all.</p>
<blockquote><p>Y forwyn gynt, fawr iawn gais,<br />
Deg aruthr erioed a gerais.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word <i>Aruthr</i>, though much used, in the sense you
take it, seems not proper here; yet Dr. Davies translates it
<i>Mirus</i>.&nbsp; I cannot think but the original import of the
word is <i>terrible</i>; and they cannot say in English of a
woman, she is <i>terribly fair</i>.&nbsp; <i>Rhuthr</i>, from
whence <i>Aruthr</i> is compounded, I dare say had that sense, at
least:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Y cythraul accw ruthrwas.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">W.
Lleyn</span>.</p>
<p>Deg wawr erioed a gerais,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>may do as well, and sounds better.</p>
<blockquote><p>A roist ofal i&rsquo;m calon,<br />
A br&acirc;th o hiraeth i&rsquo;m bron:<br />
Ni wyr un ar a anwyd<br />
A roist o gur, os teg wyd;<br />
Enwa anhunedd yn henaint<br />
A yr wyn fyth yr un faint.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first line of the last couplet is too long, and I should
write both thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>Enwa&rsquo;n hunedd yn henaint<br />
E yr wyn fyth yr un faint.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cyrchaf, ac ni fynnaf au,<br />
I dir angov drwy angau.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last couplet is a beautiful expression; but it hath too
much sweet in it; what our poets call <i>Eisiau Cyfnewid
Bogail</i>.&nbsp; <i>Ang</i>, <i>ang</i>, is a fault, which our
musicians term <i>too many</i> <!-- page 151--><a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span><i>concords</i>; and therefore they mix discords in
music, to make it more agreeable to the ear.&nbsp; So the
rhetoricians call the same fault in their science, <i>Caniad y
g&ocirc;g</i>.&nbsp; Therefore, suppose you would turn it
thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>O d&icirc;r ing af drwy angau.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lle bo dyfnaf yr afon,<br />
Ar fy hynt yr af i hon,<br />
Oni roi, Gwen eurog wedd,<br />
Drwy gariad ryw drugaredd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Eurog wedd</i> is no great compliment to a fair woman; for
<i>Gwen</i>, a Flavia, loves to be called white; and the last
line hath <i>gar</i>&mdash;<i>gar</i>, therefore I would write
thus, or the like:</p>
<blockquote><p>Oni roi, Gwen &icirc;r ei gwedd,<br />
Yn gywrain, ryw drugaredd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I do not like <i>&icirc;r ei gwedd</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Af i graig fwyaf o gr&ecirc;d<br />
Y m&ocirc;r, i gael ymwared,<br />
Ag o&rsquo;r graig fawr i&rsquo;r eigion<br />
Dygaf gyrch i dyrch y d&ograve;n&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An excellent expression&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Ag o&rsquo;r d&ograve;n egr hyd annwfn<br />
Af ar y dafl i f&ocirc;r dwfn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a charming opening for you, to describe the country
you go to, and the wonders of the deep; and something like the
following lines might be inserted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lle mae&rsquo;r morfil friwfil fron,<br />
A&rsquo;r enwog <i>f&ocirc;rforwynian</i>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To proceed:</p>
<blockquote><p>A fynno Gwen ysplennydd<br />
Yn ddiau o&rsquo;m rhwymau &rsquo;n rhydd,<br />
Ni chaf gur, ni chaf garu<br />
Na phoen gwn, na hoffi &rsquo;n gu;<br />
Ni roddaf gam i dramwy,<br />
I gred i&rsquo;th ymweled mwy:<br />
Dyna&rsquo;r modd dan wir i mi,<br />
A dyr unwaith drueni.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The expression <i>Dan</i> <i>wir</i>, is too local, and is not
understood all over Wales.&nbsp; Local expressions must be
avoided as much as possible.&nbsp; Suppose you said then,</p>
<blockquote><p>Oni chaf heb warafun<br />
Dy fodd fyth difeiwedd fun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After all these corrections, which are not very material, you
have this comfort, (and I mention it that you may not be
discouraged,) that I do not know a man in our country who can
write a poem which shall want as few corrections.&nbsp; So make
poetry and antiquity (when you can come at materials) branches of
your study; and, depend upon it, you will make a figure in the
world.&nbsp; There are flights and turns in this poem, which even
David ab Gwilym would not have been ashamed of.</p>
<p>I would have you write to my brother, and let him know the
reason of your not going to London, and that you are alive.&nbsp;
If you send him this poem, he will be pleased with it.</p>
<p>Is there any hopes of your seeing the Llyfr Coch o
Hergest?&nbsp; Who is keeper, or under-keeper, of Jesus-College
Library?&nbsp; And who is principal; and who are the fellows?
perhaps I may know some of them; or can make interest some way or
other for you to get the use of those MSS.</p>
<p>But it ought to be considered, that you are to mind the main
chance of reading the classics, in order to come to a tolerable
being, before you launch too far into any other studies; and you
must only take a snatch by the bye, which will serve to whet your
genius; <i>oblegid mae newid gwaith cystal a gorphwyso</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>When you can come at Llyfr Coch o Hergest, or any other
ancient MSS., I will send you directions to read it, and
understand it: the chief difficulty being in the orthography: the
language of all Britain (even Scotland) was the same as it is now
in Wales, 1200 years ago.</p>
<p>I wrote to you lately, which I suppose you had not received
when you sent your dateless letter.&nbsp; I desire your answer
when convenient.</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>The same to the same.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Evan</span>,</p>
<p>Your letter of the second instant, I received this day; and I
was very glad to hear that you had procured leave to go to the
private library in Jesus College.&nbsp; It is charming to get
into conversation with <i>Llywarch Hen</i>, <i>Aneurin</i>,
<i>Merddin</i>, &amp;c.&nbsp; They are most pleasing old
companions.</p>
<p>I understand that my copy of <i>Brut y Brenhinoedd</i> is not
the same with that in <i>Llyfr Coch o Hergest</i>.&nbsp; Mine was
copied out of five MSS. three of them upon vellum, very ancient;
but the transcriber, not understanding the occasion of the
difference between the copies, stuffed all into this, that he
could find in all the MSS.&nbsp; Had he known that some of those
MSS. were from Walter the Archdeacon&rsquo;s original translation
of the history, out of the Armoric; and some again from his
second translation from Galfrid&rsquo;s Latin, he would have kept
the copies separate.&nbsp; The transcriber of my copy mentions
sometimes&mdash;&ldquo;thus in such a MS. and thus in such a
MS.,&rdquo; but it is impossible to find which is which.</p>
<p><i>Brut y Tywysogion</i> is only the history of Caradoc of
Llancarvan, which was Englished by Humphrey Lloyd, and published
by Dr. Powell; and afterwards a very bad edition by Mr. W.
Wynne.&nbsp; I would not have you take the trouble upon you to
transcribe that; for there are many copies of it.&nbsp; What is
most worth your care is the works of the poets; especially that
part of them that is historical, as some of Taliesin, Merddin,
Llywarch Hen&rsquo;s are.&nbsp; Merddin mentions the war in
Scotland, between Rhydderch Hael, Aeddan ab Gafran, Gwenddolau ab
Ceidio, &amp;c., and Taliesin mentions several battles, that none
of our historians ever so much as heard of.&nbsp; These are
matters of great curiosity&mdash;Llywarch Hen in one of his
Elegies, mentions <i>Eglwysau Bassa</i>, that was destroyed by
the Saxons.&nbsp; Nennius says, that one of the twelve battles
fought by Arthur against the Saxons, was upon the river
<i>Bassas</i>.&nbsp; Who is that great Apollo among our
historians who knows anything of these affairs?&mdash;Is there
ever a MS. of Nennius, which you can come at?&nbsp; I wish that
book was translated into English: it is but small.&nbsp; However,
since you are now about the Llyfr Coch, I would have you first to
write an index of the contents of it, and send it me, sheet by
sheet, and I will give you my opinion what is best to transcribe,
and is most uncommon or curious.&nbsp; I do not remember whether
the book is paged; let it be as it will, you cannot be long in
making such an index, with the first line of each piece.&nbsp;
There are some other curious MSS. there; some <i>Bucheddau</i>
(Lives) as far as I recollect.&nbsp; But the silly copy of
<i>Brut y Brenhinoedd</i>, in a modern hand there, is not worth
talking of.&mdash;How do you know it is the same with the
Bodleian?&nbsp; I presume, that the <i>Brut y Brenhinoedd</i>, in
<i>Llyfr Coch</i>, is not the original translation from the
Bretonic copy; for I think it mentions Galfrid&rsquo;s
translation in the conclusion of it.&mdash;But it is many years
since I saw it.&nbsp; I shall ask some questions about certain
passages in it, when I have leisure to look into my own
copy.&nbsp; I have written abundance of notes, in defence of
mine, since you saw it; and the more I examine into it, the
better I like it.&nbsp; I had at first but a poor opinion of it;
being prepossessed with the character given if by English
writers; but when I find the poets, and our genealogies, and
ancient inscriptions <!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>and coins agree with it; and some
foreign writers, I do not wonder that the inveteracy of the old
Saxons should still remain against it, as long as Bede is in
being.&nbsp; I shall only ask you now,&mdash;whether the son of
Ascanius is called <i>Silius</i> or <i>Silvius</i>, in Llyfr
Coch?&nbsp; It is in the beginning of my copy, which
begins&mdash;Eneas gwedi ymladd Troya, &amp;c.&nbsp; Mine is not
divided into chapters or books.&nbsp; I have time to write no
more, but that</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I am,<br />

<h4>The same to the same.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I happened to come upon business to this place; and being so
near you, and having an hour&rsquo;s leisure, I could not help
sending this to remind you that there is such a one alive, who
wishes you well, and who is really glad you have got into such a
worthy family.&nbsp; I hope that you will make the best use of
your time; you will not be able to see how precious it is till
most part of it is gone.&nbsp; This world (or this age) is so
full of people that take no time to think at all, that a young
fellow is in the greatest danger as can be to launch out among
them.&nbsp; The terrestrial part of men being predominant, is as
apt as a monkey to imitate everything that is bad.&nbsp; So that
the little good which is to be done, must be done in spite of
nature.</p>
<p>I expected a line from you upon your being settled, and that
you had time to look about you; and when you have leisure, I
shall be glad to hear of your doing well.&nbsp; I make no doubt
but you will follow your British studies, as well as other
languages: for I suppose it will hardly leave you, whether you
will or no.&nbsp; Therefore to whet your parts, and in order to
improve yourself that way, I propose to you a correspondent, a
friend of mine, an Anglesea man; who will be glad of your
acquaintance, and I daresay <i>you</i> of <i>his</i>; especially
when you have seen some of his performances.&nbsp; His name is
Gronw Owen; and you may direct to him at Donnington, near Salop;
he keeps a school there, and is curate of a place hard by.&nbsp;
He is but lately commenced a Welsh poet; and the first ode he
ever wrote, was an imitation of your ode on melancholy.&nbsp; His
<i>Cowydd y Farn</i> is the best thing I ever read in
Welsh.&nbsp; You will be more surprised with his language and
poetry than with anything you ever saw.&nbsp; His ode is styled
<i>The Wish</i>, or Gofuned Gronw Ddu o Fon; and is certainly
equal, if not superior, to anything I ever read of the
ancients.</p>
<p>I have shared the dominion of poetry in Wales among you.&nbsp;
He shall have the north, and you the south.&nbsp; But he has more
subjects, a hundred to one, than you have, unless Glamorgan
affords some.</p>
<p>Mr. Gronw Owen has been for some years laying a foundation for
a Welsh rational Grammar, not upon the Latin and Greek plan, but
upon the plan that the language will bear.&nbsp; It would be
unreasonable to expect an old archbishop to dance a jig and
rigadoon with boys and girls; it is certain that the Greek and
Latin are such when compared with the Celtic.&nbsp; He has
desired of me to bring you acquainted together; and here I do it,
unless it is your own faults.&nbsp; He does not know how to write
to you, nor I neither; but direct this at a venture.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I am,<br />

And servant,<br />

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>My brother gave me yours of the third, with an excellent ode
to the King of Prussia.&nbsp; The faults in it I take to be owing
to your careless writing of it; for they are such as cannot be
from want of knowledge, as the ode itself shows.&nbsp; However,
as you desire my corrections (which seems to be a sort of menial
office, like a plaisterer, who daubs mortar on a grand piece of
building, designed by a great architect) I give you my labour for
nothing, and choose whether you follow my opinion or no; for I am
no oracle.&nbsp; In my last alterations, in Cowydd Teifi, your
line&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Dy lif y loywaf afon&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is certainly best.&nbsp; I only wrote something that came
uppermost, to egg you on to do better.&nbsp; Your notion of
<i>Maelienydd</i> is wrong.&nbsp; You have been imposed upon by
Camden, Selden, or perhaps, by Girald. Cambrensis; or by some of
those strangers that knew nothing of the matter.&nbsp;
<i>Maelienydd</i> was the country to the south and east of those
mountains.&nbsp; But this is besides my purpose.&nbsp; Well, as
you think the unity of design, scene, and action of your poem was
about <i>Llyn Teifi</i>, I shall not urge the description of
<i>Teifi</i> as low as the sea (for there it goes.)&nbsp; And I
could have wished you had done it; for nobody else in
Cardiganshire is able to do poor <i>Teifi</i> that
kindness.&nbsp; As for your sheltering under Horace&rsquo;s
adage, I mind it as nothing.&nbsp; He was a stranger to our
methods, handed down to us by his masters, the druidical bards;
who knew how to sing before Rome had a name.&nbsp; So never,
hereafter, mention such moderns as Horace and Virgil, when you
talk of British poetry.&nbsp; Llywarch Hen, Aneurin, and
followers of the Druids, are our men; and nature our rule.</p>
<p>With respect to your borrowing Gronw&rsquo;s manuscript, you
may make yourself easy about it.&nbsp; I dare say he would sooner
part with his wife, and, for aught I know, children too; but his
wife I am sure.&nbsp; Your sentiments of Gronw&rsquo;s capacity
as a poet, are I believe just; for he has had greater
opportunities than any poet since the Norman Conquest.&nbsp; But,
if you take my word, you will not be behind him, if you stick to
it.&nbsp; And, that you may not complain for want of the
necessary requisites, as soon as ever I have any leisure, I will
send you an ode or two of the ancients, which are not in
Gronw&rsquo;s book, to whet your Awen with.&nbsp; I have a fine
collection of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, which I value
more than their weight in fine gold.</p>

<h4>The same to the same.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>It is now almost an age since I heard from you.&nbsp; From an
annual animal it would be a proper expression; and I am but
little better, as I change for the worse every year, till I shall
be no more.</p>
<p>I was glad to hear you had got to Llanrhychwyn; a place
scarcely ever heard of by the inhabitants of the level countries;
where you roll I suppose, in ancient MSS. and curiosities; and
where the arms of the invaders hardly ever reached.</p>
<p>Mr. W. Wynne was with me one night lately; and it seems he
hath as many ancient MSS. as other people have printed books:
<i>Gwyn ei fyd</i>!&nbsp; I was very much out of order when he
was here, which deprived me of the pleasure I should otherwise
have had.</p>
<p><!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>I had a visit paid me lately by John Bradford, of
Glamorganshire (darn o brydydd &amp;c.)&nbsp; It seems that
country is entirely drained of it, valuable antiquities or else,
their MSS. are buried among the rubbish of old libraries
unheeded.</p>
<p>The more I look into Nennius the difficulties encrease: for he
has been so mangled by ignorant or unskilful readers and
transcribers, and by Gale the editor, that, without a body had a
sight of all the manuscript copies of it in the public libraries,
or elsewhere, there is no attempting to interpret it.&nbsp; Mr.
R. Vaughan&rsquo;s MS. at Hengwrt would be a vast help; but I see
no likelihood to come at a sight of that.&nbsp; Any ancient copy
of it on vellum, which has not been dabbled with, or compared
with the Cambridge, the Oxford MSS. &amp;c.; that is, one which
we might call a virgin manuscript, which hath not been ravished
by Camden, Markham, Sir S. D&rsquo;Ewes, or Usher, would give
great satisfaction; but where is that to be found?&nbsp; That
which Sir J. Pryse had may possibly exist somewhere; and that
which Humphrey Lloyd had, may likely be in the neighbourhood of
Denbigh still.</p>
<p>I have not had a week&rsquo;s health since I saw you, and
therefore have been in no good humour to read or write.</p>
<p>Have you, among Taliesin&rsquo;s works, Ymddyddan rhwng Ugnach
ab Mydno o Gaerleon a Thaliesin o Gaerdyganwy?&nbsp; If you have
it not, I will send it you.&nbsp; It is from the Llyfr Du o
Gaerfyrddin.</p>
<p>My chief business of late has been to put the names of men and
places in an alphabetical order, and to prepare them for my
Celtic remains, from Taliesin&rsquo;s works, Sir J. Pryse&rsquo;s
Cambria, the Triades, the Gododin, Beddau Milwyr, Aera Cambr.
Brit. L. G. Cothi, and extent of Anglesea.</p>
<p>Remember that you promised me the remainder of the Gododin,
and never performed it.&nbsp; The last lines of the fragment
which I have, are</p>
<blockquote><p>Tymor tymhestyl<br />
Tymhestyl dymor<br />
Y beri rhestr rhac rhiallu.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am now out of the way of all curious antiquities; and you
who have an opportunity of seeing every body&rsquo;s treasures,
keep them all to yourself.&nbsp; I long to see the Legends of our
Welsh Saints (Buchedd y seintiau).&nbsp; I forgot to tell you,
that I am at this very time putting the names of all the parishes
in Wales into alphabetical order, for the above purpose.&nbsp;
But I find my catalogue of the parishes is not very correct;
therefore I must desire the assistance of some that live near the
places that are doubtful, and have their correction, or opinion
of them.&nbsp; One of them is Llangynsarn.&nbsp; I never heard
but of three Plwy&rsquo;r Creuddyn.&nbsp; Is there a Llangedol
near Bangor?&nbsp; Are there parishes called Llangedyrn,
Bodfrenin, Llandydwen, Betwnog in Lleyn, or how otherwise
called?&nbsp; Is there a parish called Llansilien, near Corwen in
Edeyrnion?&nbsp; Or is it Llansilian, or Tyssilio?&nbsp; Are
there parishes called Llanelidan, and Y Fynechdid, in Cantref
Dyffryn Clwyd: and what is the etymology of them; and also of
Llanhychen; and whence is Llanferrys yn Ial derived; and who is
Trillo, and Trillo Caenog; and what is the common opinion of the
derivation of the name of Gyffylliog?</p>
<p>I shall stop here at present; and leave Flintshire,

<p>I think you have a vote for a knight of the shire, in this

would not advise to any thing but what would be of advantage to
you.&nbsp; Let me hear from you about this point.</p>
<p>I am surprised Dewi Fardd does not come with his books, to
deliver to the subscribers.&nbsp; I do not hear that they are
come to Aberystwith.&nbsp; He has murdered a good book, by
inserting in it the works of the greatest blockheads of the
creation, and the most illiterate creatures that bear human
shapes; such as Robert Humphrey, &amp;c., &amp;c.&mdash;Ffei ffei

but I am heartily sorry for poor Hugh Morris.&nbsp; If he knows
of this, that he must stand in spite of his teeth, in company
with people that were not worthy to carry the feathers of his
quill; and the room which his poem should have filled up, taken
by persons as far below him as a <i>Crythor Crwth Trithiant</i>
is below Corelli or Vivaldi.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I received your kind favour by Dewi, with the remainder of the
Gododin, and some of the Gorchanau.&nbsp; Be so good as to let me
know from whence these have been copied, and whether I can depend
upon their being correct.&nbsp; I suppose it is your mistake in
writing Breint mab <i>Bleidgi</i>, for <i>Bleidig</i>.&nbsp; It
seems the Gododin was not one entire piece, but was written in
distinct odes; or else what means the preface to the
Gorchanau?&nbsp; But where are the distinctions in the
copy?&nbsp; I wish we had a correct one: I can make little or
nothing of this.</p>
<p>David Jones tells me of a Llanerch copy of <i>Brut y
Brenhinoedd</i>, in folio on paper, written by Edward Kyffin, for
John Trefor, of Trevalun.&nbsp; I wish I had the beginning and
ending of it, as I took off the vellum book, that you brought
here; and if you would do the same by the other copies there, I
should be glad to see it.&nbsp; By this management we shall be
able to distinguish between Galfrid&rsquo;s, Walter&rsquo;s
translation, and Tyssilio&rsquo;s original.</p>
<p>I thank you for the inscription at Llanfor, and that at
Foel-las.&nbsp; I dare determine nothing about them as yet; only
that Mr. Edward Llwyd&rsquo;s reading is only the froth of a
fertile brain.&nbsp; When you copy inscriptions, cut a bit of
chalk into a pencil, and trace the letters.&nbsp; In old
inscriptions there are often natural lines in the stone; and
sometimes lines worn out, which must be supplied with
chalk.&nbsp; I suspect you had no chalk at Llanfor; and that your
<span class="smcap">ENIARCH</span> may be Llywarch, or <span
class="smcap">LYVARCH</span>.&nbsp; I wish I could see it.&nbsp;
Are you sure, there is not part of it covered still with
lime?</p>
<p>I thank you also for John Owen&rsquo;s Elegy&mdash;a good
one&mdash;I had got it from the navy office; and also Mr. W.
Wynne&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Mr. Pegge, in a letter lately to Dr. Phillips, says that he
has borrowed a MS. of Mr. Davies of Llanerch, which Mr. Pegge has
now in his study; and which he says will be of good use to
him.&nbsp; Pray what can it be?&nbsp; I have converted Mr. Pegge
from the Camdenian faction; and we shall by and by see whether he
is an ally of consequence.&nbsp; He is perfectly satisfied with
my defence of Tyssilio; and wishes to see a translation of his
book.&nbsp; Mr. Davies knows something of him I suppose.</p>
<p>I am glad your spitting of blood is over; take care, your life
is precious, whether you have a fat living or no.&nbsp; Dont
despair; some men of sense may take notice of you; though, even
among the ancient Britons, canonization went seldom out of great
families, as appears by <i>Bonedd y Saint</i>, which I have at
last completed, as far as my materials reached.&nbsp; I now
plainly see that the Llanerch MS. of Bonedd is but a fragment;
for there is not a syllable of the Brychan family in it; and but
very little of the Caw family.&nbsp; I have reduced the <!-- page
157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>whole into genealogical order; and they take but a very
narrow compass.&nbsp; I shall have some difficulty in fixing the
times of these saints; for there is some confusion among them,
occasioned by the blunders of transcribers.</p>
<p>They have been all hunting after the Llanerch MS. of
<i>Bonedd</i>, even Dr. Thomas Williams, and the Anglesea Man, as
well as Thomas Wynne, and Thomas ab Llewelyn, &amp;c., and have
stumbled in the reading of it, as now plainly appears to me; and
what, if I tell you, that you and I also have slipped in one
place: I am sure we have.</p>
<p>I am tired now, and have no more to say, but I cough a little
less than I did a week ago; and am likely to live till winter at
least, unless some unforeseen accident happens.&nbsp; It will be
a hard battle if I hold out all the winter.&nbsp; You are now in
your bloom of body and spirit; do not lose a moment; you will be
sorry if you do.&nbsp; God be with you, and keep you.</p>

<h4>The same to the same.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>It is a long while since I heard from you, and really I
don&rsquo;t know when; for my long and dangerous illness has
eradicated all former transactions out of my memory, so that I
have but a very faint idea of my former letters sent or
received.&nbsp; From the beginning of November to this time, I
have been struggling with death at his door; and in the very
height of my fever, an accident by fire had likely to have
destroyed me and mine.&nbsp; Such shocks are terrible, and enough
to deface all correspondence.&nbsp; I am now beginning to be able
to sit down to write a little, and but very little; for I am
severely troubled with an asthma, which I suppose will finish me
one day or other.&nbsp; <i>Chwilio</i>, <i>chwilio a ffaelio cael
eich llythyr diwaethaf mewn modd yn y byd</i>.&nbsp; At the time
when a pleuretic fever knocked me down, I was fitting up a new
closet for my books and papers, and ever since everything has
been in confusion, so that I am as long finding out a book or
paper, as if I was in Mostyn Library.</p>
<p>Now I think on it, my brother of the navy office tells me,
that you have lately met with two or three copies of Brut y
Brenhinoedd at Mostyn.&nbsp; I shall be very much obliged to you
for an extract of the beginning of each, and of the conclusion,
to see if we can come at a genuine copy, which hath not been
mixed with Galfrid or Walter; and should be glad to know if you
have met with any British books written in the old letter (called
now the Saxon), besides a line or two, in the beginning of the
Welsh Charter, in Liber Landavensis, which you sent me; and
whether all that charter be not written in the same character, or
any thing else in that book.&nbsp; This seems to me to be the
case with respect to that character, that it was the one which
the Druids used, and all Britain and its islands, before the
Roman conquest.&nbsp; That the provincial Britains, immediately
under the Roman power took the Roman letters; therefore we are
not to look for the old character among the Loegrian Britains,
nor the Armoricans, nor the Cornish.&nbsp; That the Druids taking
their shelter in Wales, Ireland, and the highlands of the North,
the British party <i>there</i> retained the old character; but
the Roman party took to their new letter; and in process of time,
both the Roman and British characters were mixed; as we find them
upon some tombstones in Wales, (but not in England) soon after
the Saxon conquest.&nbsp; The Irish still retain their old
letter; but it seems the Britains laid it quite aside, about the
time of the Norman conquest, or before.&nbsp; The North Britains
retained it for some time, as appears by those ancient verses,
which Mr. Edward Llwyd mentions, and which he takes to be the
Pictish.&nbsp; The inscriptions on Pabo&rsquo;s and
Iestin&rsquo;s tombs, are proofs of what I say; and that of
Catamanus, in Llangadwaladyr, of the mixed <!-- page 158--><a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>letter.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas Carte, who had the loan of the
Liber Landav. sent me word, that it was written in the Saxon
character.&nbsp; It seems he only dipt into the beginning of it,
and took all the rest to be the same, or perhaps there may be
passages in it here and there, which are in that character.&nbsp;
You told me that all the old grants were written in a good strong
hand, like my <i>Cnute&rsquo;s grant</i>, but better rather; and
yet in the donation of Iudhail, which you sent me, I find some of
the old characters.&nbsp; I also observe that if all the book is
written in the same strong good hand, it is not an original; for
it is impossible to find persons to write the same hand for
hundreds of years successively; and if I remember well, Sir John
Pryse, in his defence of British History, mentions some grants,
which were scarcely legible in the Liber Landav. in his time; and
yet you say, that there are donations therein down to bishop
Herwaldus, about 1104.&nbsp; Doth not that shew that the book is
only a copy, taken after the Norman conquest, with some notes of
later date?</p>
<p>Set me right in these things; for I am at an entire loss about
them.&nbsp; This is all I have leisure to write at present, and
should be glad to hear from you&mdash;who am,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>A person told me lately, that he had seen you at Hengwrt, in
your way home from me; and that you were permitted to look over
what MSS. you pleased; and that you translated them offhand into
English, as if they had been the common text of the Welsh
Bible.</p>
<p>I was very glad of this, and I hope you have met there with
the so much desired copy of Nennius, which has had the benefit of
Mr. Robert Vaughan&rsquo;s hand, and which must be the test to
all others; and then we shall see a genuine Nennius come out in
English, as far as the nature of the thing will bear.</p>
<p>If I can be of any service to you in this arduous task,
nothing of my endeavours shall be wanting; and for God&rsquo;s
sake begin to translate into English, as fast as you can, and let
me see it as you go on, perhaps I may help you to some notes, or
some illustrations or other.&nbsp; I have Nennius and Tyssilio
much at heart, and I cannot be long on this side the grave.</p>
<p>Inclosed I send you the old papers, you talked of when
here.&nbsp; I never looked into them till now; and cannot guess
at the authors quoted therein, except G. for Galfrid; T. W.
Thomas Williams, and H. Lh. Humphry Llwyd.&nbsp; What is Scr.
Sc., and H. C.?</p>
<p>Be sure to keep up your correspondence with that very curious
and valuable man, Mr. Percy.&nbsp; I am afraid that there are not
many such learned critics in the kingdom.</p>
<p>I was heartily sorry to see you in those foolish difficulties,
when you were here last.&nbsp; For heaven&rsquo;s sake, for your
own sake, and for the sake of us all, do not run yourself into
those excesses; but shew the world that you have not only
learning and knowledge, far above the common herd; but that you
have also discretion and prudence, without which no man will ever
arrive at greatness.&nbsp; Nennius will set you up out of the
reach of little folks, if you stick to him.</p>

have read in the little book many good C. of D. ap Gwilym since I
saw you, tho&rsquo; there are some very poor ones amongst
them.&nbsp; What I had then read were looked over in haste, and
it is impossible to form a right judgment of such things, without
a careful perusal, especially when there are uncommon words or
various readings to disturb the attention, as there are many in
this book.&nbsp; I desire you&rsquo;ll dash out of my Cywydd y

successively, where there are a great many MSS., though few to
your taste or mine.&mdash;English history, exploded philosophy,
monkish theology, and such trash in abundance, written on fine
vellum, in a most curious manner.&nbsp; Three good pedigree
books, six or seven volumes of Welsh poetry, but for the most
part very incorrect.&nbsp; Some of them are most shamefully
mangled by the transcribers.&nbsp; I have borrowed one large
quarto, transcribed about the conclusion of Queen
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, by an ignorant, slovenly fellow, who has
murdered the orthography in a most barbarous manner.&nbsp; Yet I
think it valuable, because, upon collating some parts of it with
other copies, I found it in the general more genuine than the
common run, notwithstanding the barbarity of the
orthography.&nbsp; Where <i>tarw garw</i> occur, this scribbler
always robs the line of a syllable, which is the greatest injury
he commits.&nbsp; I have transcribed <i>Duchan Gwyddelyn</i>, o

<p>There is at Llannerch a little old rag, consisting of about 20
pages accurately written, out of which I have transcribed a
curious ode if not two.&nbsp; It begins thus: <i>Nid wyf
ddihynwyf hoen</i>.&nbsp; <i>Kreirwy hoywdec am hudawdd mal
Garwy</i>.&nbsp; After eight Englyns, there is a blank, without
the author&rsquo;s name, and below that begins either another ode
of the same person&rsquo;s, or a remainder of the foregoing,
beginning thus: <i>Mireinwawr drefawr dra vo brad ymddwyn</i>,
and subscribed Howel ap Eignion ai cant i Vevanwy vechan o
Gastell Dinas Bran.&nbsp; After the last stanza is written
<i>Mireinwawr drefawr</i>, with a dash, which makes me suppose
they are two poems, though on the same subject; because it is
common to conclude an ode with a repetition of the first
stanza.&mdash;Quere, Whether the first of these is not the same
with your Awdl Myfanwy?&nbsp; I cannot recollect, but I think it
is longer than yours; it ends thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lliw eiry cynnar pen Aran&mdash;<br />
Lloer bryd lwys fryd o lys Vran.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I lately borrowed a quarto, fairly written by a man of
learning and great knowledge in antiquities, but ignorant of the
Welsh prosody, for which reason it is not very correct.&nbsp;
There are many of D. G. in it, Owdl Fair, by I. R. I. Ll. of
Gogerddan; one quarter of which is Latin.&nbsp; I have seen the
same in another book given to D. N---, Mawl Edw. 3 ryw bryd gwedi
Aerfa Cressi, o waith Iolo.&mdash;That battle was fought in the
year 1346.&mdash;Edw IIId. died 1377.&mdash;This is demonstration
that Iolo ought to have been placed much higher in chronology
than the year 1400; and by his own testimony we find he was a
mere <i>Cleirirach</i> before the commencement of the 15th
century, though he lived about ten years after.&nbsp; This,
though in Iolo&rsquo;s usual style, I think the most ancient
Cywydd I ever saw, excepting one of D. Ddu, <i>Digam gwnaeth Duw

Iolo.&nbsp; <i>Mar.</i> <i>Tywysog Llewelyn</i>&mdash;Gwaith

of Coed Panton, and Plas Panton, in the parish of Llan Nefydd,

that bear the name of Merddin, may be his, but I judge they are
not his compositions by the style, though it is not modern.&nbsp;
Some called Taliesin&rsquo;s, I believe were forged by the Monks,
others I think genuine.&nbsp; The prophecies are worth reading,

Gronwy&rsquo;s ode is an excellent thing; but what he calls
<i>Cadwyn fyr</i> is erroneous, because it is in reality
<i>Cadwyn gyflawn</i>.&nbsp; I do not blame him for this, because
Dr. IDR&rsquo;s imperfect rule and false examples led him into
this error.&nbsp; Some, perhaps, may be offended because the ode
part is not <i>unirythm</i>, which it is supposed to be by the
very name; but I do not like the poem the worse for that.&nbsp; I
shewed you the true <i>Cadwyn fyr</i> in W. Ll&rsquo;s grammar,
and likewise in S. F&rsquo;s.&mdash;I have since had the same in
a book of Gr. Hirs, who was the chief professor of the age, and a

<h4>Dr. Percy, late Bishop Dromore, to the Rev. Evan Evans.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>By my friend Mr. Williams, rector of Weston, Staffordshire, I
have been informed of the great attention you have bestowed on
British Literature, and the pains you have taken to rescue the
productions of your ancient Bards from oblivion.&nbsp; Though I
have not the happiness to understand, yet I have a great
veneration for, the ancient language of this Island, and have
always had a great desire to see some of the most early and most
original productions in it.&nbsp; I could never yet obtain a
proper gratification of this desire; for, to their shame be it
spoken, most of your countrymen, instead of vindicating their
ancient and truly venerable mother tongue from that contempt,
which is only the result of ignorance, rather encourage it by
endeavouring to forget it themselves.&nbsp; Besides my friend Mr.
Williams, whose constant residence in England has deprived him of
the means of cultivating <!-- page 161--><a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>his native
language so much as he would have done, I never met with one
native of Wales, who could give me any satisfactory account of
the literary productions of his own country, or seemed to have
bestowed any attention on its language and antiquities.&nbsp; Not
so the Scots:&mdash;they are everywhere recommending the
antiquity of their own country to public notice, vindicating its
history, and setting off its poetry, and, by dint of constant
attention to their grand national concern, have prevailed so far,
as to have the broken jargon they speak to be considered as the
most proper language for our pastoral poetry.&nbsp; Our most
polite ladies affect to lisp out Scottish airs; and in the Senate
itself whatever relates to the Scottish Nation is always
mentioned with peculiar respect.&nbsp; Far from blaming this
attention in the Scotch I think it much to their credit, and am
sorry, that a large class of our fellow-subjects with whom we
were united in the most intimate union for many ages, before
Scotland ceased to be our <i>most</i> inveterate enemy, have not
shewn the same respect to the peculiarities of their own
country.&nbsp; But, by their supineness and neglect, have
suffered a foolish and inveterate prejudice to root itself in the
minds of their compatriots, the English,&mdash;a prejudice which
might have been in a good measure prevented, had the Welsh
gentlemen occasionally given them specimens of the treasures
contained in their native language, which may even yet be in part
removed by the same means.</p>
<p>You have translated, I am informed, some of the Odes of your
ancient Bards.&nbsp; I wish you would proceed and make a select
collection of the best of them, and so give them to the
world.&nbsp; You have probably heard what a favourable reception
the public has given to an English version of some Erse Fragments
imported from the Highlands of Scotland, and, if you have never
seen them, I will send them to you.&nbsp; I am verily persuaded,
an elegant translation of some curious pieces of ancient British
Poetry would be as well received, if executed in the same
manner.&nbsp; I may modestly pretend to have some credit with the
booksellers, and with Mr. Dodsley in particular, who is my
intimate friend.&nbsp; I shall be very happy to do you any good
office with him, and shall be glad to make such an attempt as
profitable to you as, I am persuaded, it will be reputable both
to you and your country.</p>
<p>I have prevailed on a friend to attempt a Translation of some
ancient Runic Odes, composed among the snows of Norway, which
will make their appearance at Mr. Dodsley&rsquo;s shop next
winter.&nbsp; My very learned friend and neighbour, the Rev. Mr.
Lye, editor of Junius&rsquo;s Etymologicon, and of
Ulphila&rsquo;s Gothic Gospels, (whose skill in the northern
languages has rendered him famous all over Europe,) is now
rescuing some valuable remains of Saxon Poetry from oblivion, and
I can perhaps obtain leave of him to let you see one of these
odes by way of specimen, accompanied with his version.&nbsp; I
have not been altogether idle myself; but my attention has been
chiefly bestowed on the languages spoken in the southern parts of
Europe.&nbsp; I have collected some curious pieces of ancient
Spanish Poetry, and when I have translated a select collection of
them, may perhaps give them to the public.&nbsp; Amidst the
general attention of ancient and foreign poetry it would be a
pity to leave that of the Ancient Britons forgotten and
neglected, and therefore, when I heard that a person so capable
was employed in collecting and translating those valuable
remains, it gave me a very sensible pleasure, and I could not
help expressing in a <i>volunteer</i> letter to you, the sense I
entertain of the obligation, which you will undoubtedly confer on
all real lovers of literature and the productions of
antiquity.</p>
<p>If you will favour me with a line containing a more particular
account of what has been the object of your labours, I shall be
able to form a more exact idea of the success, that may be
expected from them than I can at present.&nbsp; I will also
communicate them to several eminent Literati of my acquaintance,
and to mention one in particular, Mr Johnson, the author of the
Dictionary, Rambler, &amp;c., who will, I am sure, be glad to
recommend your work, and to give you any advice for the most
advantageous disposal of it.&nbsp; If you take these voluntary
offers of service in good part, you will please to favour me with
a line, and I would wish also a specimen of your labours,
together with a full direction where to write to you.&nbsp; I am
a Clergyman, and shall receive any favour of this kind, that is

<p>P.S.&nbsp; I am told you are acquainted with Mr. Gray, the
poet.&nbsp; Pray has he any foundation for what he has asserted
in his Ode on the British Bards, viz. that there is a tradition
among the inhabitants of Wales, that our Edward the First
destroyed all the British Bards that fell into his hands?&nbsp;
The existence of such a tradition has been doubted.</p>
<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>The same to the same.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>That I have so long defer&rsquo;d answering your very obliging
letter has been altogether owing to the following cause.&nbsp; I
proposed sending you a Saxon ode, accompanied with a Latin
literal and an English free version; the former done by my very
learned friend Mr. Lye, from out of whose curious collections I
transcribed both it and the original.&nbsp; But, having left it
with him to give it a revise, he has unfortunately mislaid both
the original and copy, so that, although he has for this month
past occasionally endeavour&rsquo;d to recover them, he has not
been able to succeed.&nbsp; As soon as they emerge from the
immense ocean of his papers, you may depend upon receiving this
curious specimen of Saxon poetry.&nbsp; In the mean time I would
not defer any longer returning you thanks for the curious and
valuable contents of your letter.&nbsp; I admire your Welsh ode
very much; it contains a large portion of the sublime.&nbsp; The
images are very bold and animated, and poured forth with such
rapidity, as argues an uncommon warmth of imagination in the
bard, whose mind seems to have been so filled with his subject,
and the several scenes of the war appear to have so crowded in
upon him, that he has not leisure to mark the transitions with
that cool accuracy, which a feebler genius would have been
careful to have done.&nbsp; It is one continued fiery torrent of
poetic flame, which, like the eruptions of Etna, bears down all
opposition.</p>
<p>You must pardon me if I think your critical friend quite
mistaken in his remarks on this ode.&nbsp; He confounds two
species of poetry as distinct and different as black and
white.&nbsp; Epic poetry delights in circumstance, and it is only
in proportion as it is circumstantial that it has merit; the very
essence of it (as its name implies) is narration.&nbsp; So a
narrative, devoid of all circumstances, must be very jejune,
confused, and unsatisfactory.&nbsp; But here lies the great art
of the epic poet,&mdash;that he can be minute and circumstantial
without descending from the sublime, or exciting other than grand
and noble ideas.&nbsp; Thus, when Homer describes the stone,
which Diomede threw at &AElig;neas, had be only told us in
general terms, that it was a large one,</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash; &Omicron; &delta;&epsilon;
&chi;&epsilon;&rho;&mu;&alpha;&delta;&iota;&omicron;&nu;
&lambda;&alpha;&theta;&epsilon;
&chi;&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&iota;<br />
&Tau;&upsilon;&delta;&epsilon;&iota;&delta;&eta;&sigmaf;,
&mu;&epsilon;y&alpha; &epsilon;&rho;y&omicron;&nu;,&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>had he stopped here, as many an inferior poet would have done,
should we have had so great an idea of the hero&rsquo;s strength
or vigour, as when he adds the following particular and striking
circumstances?</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash; &Omicron; &omicron;&upsilon;
&delta;&upsilon;&omega; y' &alpha;&nu;&delta;&rho;&epsilon;
&phi;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&iota;&epsilon;&nu;,<br />
&Omicron;&iota;&omicron;&iota; &nu;&upsilon;&nu;
&Beta;&rho;&omicron;&tau;&omicron;&iota; &epsilon;&iota;&sigma;,
&omicron; &delta;&epsilon; &mu;&iota;&nu; &rho;&epsilon;&alpha;
&pi;&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&epsilon; &kappa;&alpha;&iota;
&omicron;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Iliad E.&nbsp; 1.304.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>On the other hand, it is the essence of ode to neglect
circumstance, being more confin&rsquo;d in its plan, and having
the sublime equally for its object.&nbsp; In order to attain
this, it is obliged to deal in general terms, to give only such
hints as will forcibly strike the imagination, from which we may
infer the particulars ourselves.&nbsp; It is no demerit or
disparagement in your bard to have neglected the minute
circumstances of the battle, because it would have been
impossible for him to have described them within the narrow
limits of his ode.&nbsp; Here lies his great merit, that he
hints, he drops, and the images he throws out, supply the absence
of a more minute detail, and excite as grand ideas as the best
description could have done.&nbsp; And so far I agree with your
critical friend, that no poet ever hit upon a grander image than
that of &ldquo;<i>A Menai heb drai o drallanw</i>,&rdquo;
&amp;c., nor could take a nobler method to excite our admiration
at the prodigious cause of so amazing an effect.&nbsp; So much
for criticism.</p>
<p>Soon after I received your letter I was down at Cambridge,
where I had the good fortune to meet with Mr. Gray, the poet, and
spent an afternoon with him at his chambers.&nbsp; Our discourse
turned on you and the Welsh poetry: I shewed him your letter, and
he desired leave to transcribe the passage relating to King
Edward&rsquo;s massacre of the Welsh bards.&nbsp; All the
authority he had before, it seems, was only a short hint in
Carte&rsquo;s history: he seemed very glad of this authentic
extract.&nbsp; We both join&rsquo;d in wishing a speedy
conclusion to your historical labours, that you might be at
leisure to enter upon this far more noble field of ancient
British poetry.&nbsp; Excuse me if I think the recovery of
particular facts from oblivion, any further than as they
contribute to throw light upon compositions, not half of so much
consequence to the world, as to recover the compositions
themselves.</p>
<p>Your nation and ours are now happily consolidated in one firm
indissoluble mass, and it is of very little importance, whether
Llewelyn or Edward had the advantage in such a particular
encounter.&nbsp; At least very few (even learned and inquisitive
readers) will interest themselves in such an
enquiry,&mdash;whereas the productions of genius, let them come
from what quarter they will, are sure to attract the attention of
all.&nbsp; Every reader of taste, of whatever country or faction,
listens with pleasure, and forms a higher or meaner opinion of
any people, in proportion as they are affected by this exertion
of their intellectual powers.&nbsp; To give an instance, that is
parallel to your own case, the Danes and Swedes have, for this
century past, been rescuing their ancient writings from oblivion;
they have printed off their Icelandic Histories, and collected
what they could of their ancient Runic Poems.&nbsp; The latter
have attracted the attention of all Europe; while the former are
no otherwise regarded, than as they contribute to throw light on
the latter.&nbsp; A very celebrated Frenchman has lately
translated some curious specimens of them into his own language;
and Mr. Dodsley will soon print a curious Spicilegium of the same
kind in English, of which I will procure a copy and send you when
printed off.&nbsp; But who will be at the pains (except a few
northern antiquaries) to give a careful perusal to the
other?&nbsp; I have this moment a voluminous <i>corpus</i> of
them (lately borrowed) before me.&nbsp; Even curious and
inquisitive, as you are yourself, into historical facts, let me
ask you if you would be willing to read 800 pages folio, in a
barbarous literal Latin version, concerning the exploits of King
Haquin Sarli; the mighty achievements of Ghorfinne Harlecefni,
and of twenty other valiant barbarians?&nbsp; Yet, when you come
to read the native undenied poetic descriptions of the ancient
Runic Bards, their forcible images, their strong paintings, their
curious display of ancient manners, I defy the most torpid reader
not to be animated and affected; and then we are content to make
some enquiry after the history of these savage heroes, that we
may understand the songs of which they are the subjects.&nbsp; In
like manner, with regard to your own Owain Gwynedd, without
intending the least disrespect to so valiant a prince, I believe
few readers will desire to know any further of his history, than
as it will serve for a comment to Gwalchmai&rsquo;s very sublime
and animated Ode.&nbsp; After all, I would not have any
historical monuments perish, or be totally neglected.&nbsp; They
may come into use upon a thousand occasions, that we cannot at
present foresee, and therefore I am glad, that the northern
nations have been careful to secure even the above (to us
uninteresting) narratives from destruction.&nbsp; And I should be
very glad to have the same care taken of those of the ancient
Britons.&nbsp; But I think the first <!-- page 164--><a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>care is due
to these noble remains of ancient genius, which are in so much
greater danger or perishing, because so much harder to be
understood.</p>
<p>How strongly is our curiosity excited by the mention you make
(in your letter to Mr. Williams), of the Epic Poem, written in
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 578, and the other works of
Aneurin Gwawdrydd.&nbsp; What a noble field for literary
application to rescue such a fine monument of antiquity from
oblivion: to which every revolving year of delay will most
certainly consign it, till it is lost for ever!&nbsp; <i>Hic
Labor</i>, <i>hoc opus</i>.&nbsp; I hope, dear Sir, you will take
in good part the freedom, with which I have ventured to advise
you on a subject, of which you are so much a better judge than
myself; but my zeal, though it may be blind, is well meant.&nbsp;
I would fain excite you to direct that application, which you so
laudably bestow on your ancient language, in such a manner as may
be most profitable to yourself, and most reputable to your
country.</p>
<p>Macpherson goes on furiously in picking up subscriptions for
his proposed Translation of the ancient Epic Poem in the Erse
Language; though hardly one reader in ten believes the specimens
produced to be genuine.&nbsp; Much greater attention would be due
to an editor, who rescues the original itself from oblivion, and
fixes its meaning by an accurate version.&nbsp; I entirely agree
with you, that a Latin version, as literal as possible, should
accompany such ancient pieces, but then I would also have you
subjoin at the same time a liberal English translation.&nbsp; By
this means your book will take in all readers, both the learned
and the superficial.&nbsp; This method of publication has been
attended with great success among the northern nations, where all
their Runic Pieces have been confronted both with a literal
version in Latin, and a more spirited one in the modern languages
either of Sweden or Denmark.&nbsp; Were you to endeavour to
collect into a corpus all the remains of your ancient poetry, and
print it by subscription begun among your own countrymen, and
warmly recommended by them to us, it would certainly pay well,
and be a very valuable present to the public; but then you ought
to send forth a few select pieces into the world, previous to
such an undertaking, to bespeak the good opinion of mankind, and
this, whenever you please to execute it, shall be attended with
my warmest services.&nbsp; In the mean time I hope you will
continue to favour me with specimens of your ancient poetry as
often as your leisure will permit; and, if any thing else that is
curious should occur in the course of your studies, you will
confer a great pleasure by imparting it to,</p>

<h4>The same to the same.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I know not whether the favour you have done me, in having
wrote to me once or twice, entitles me to address you with the
familiarity of a near acquaintance; but I have ventured to
trouble you with a voluntary letter.&nbsp; I presume you have
received a very long one from me through the medium of Mr.
Williams.&nbsp; In that I requested to know if you had any good
old popular ballads in the Welsh language on historical and
romantic subjects.&nbsp; This was not a random question.&nbsp; I
have in my possession a very ancient MS. collection of such
pieces in our own language, some of which will throw great light
on our old poets.&nbsp; I have selected two for your inspection,
which, when perused, do me the favour to return, and inform me
whether you can remember any on the same subjects in the <!--
page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>Cambrian tongue.&nbsp; I have reason to believe both
the inclosed pieces are of great antiquity.&nbsp; The fragment is
certainly more ancient than the time of Chaucer, who took his Old
Wife Bath&rsquo;s tale from it, as any one upon perusal will be
convinced, and consequently that the song was not taken from
Chaucer.&nbsp; I cannot help thinking many of these pieces, about
King Arthur, translations from the ancient British tongue; and it
is in order to receive information on this subject, that I now
apply to you.&nbsp; I am going to print a select collection of
these old pieces, not only on account of the merit of the poetry
which they contain, (and even these display proofs of great
invention,) but also as conducing to illustrate our best old
poets who frequently allude to these compositions.&nbsp; As the
press waits, I would intreat the favour of a speedy answer.&nbsp;
I shall soon be able to send you a specimen of some Runic poetry;
which, you will find, bears a surprising similitude to your own
Welsh songs, more specimens of which, at your leisure, will
oblige,</p>

<h4>The same to the same.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I received the favour of your obliging letter and the valuable
present of the two British Odes translated into English.&nbsp;
They have afforded me great pleasure, and they display a rich
vein of poetry.&nbsp; I think a select collection of such pieces,
thrown into a shilling pamphlet, would not fail to prove as
acceptable to the public as the Erse Fragments, and would be far
more satisfactory, because you could remove all suspicions of
their genuineness, which, I am afraid, Mr. Macpherson is not able
to do.&nbsp; I observe with you a remarkable similarity between
our Runic and your British pieces.&nbsp; As our Runic Poetry will
be fit for publication towards Michaelmas, I wish you could get
ready such another Collection of British Poetry to follow it in
due time, while the curiosity of the public is fixed on these
subjects.&nbsp; And, when all these pamphlets have had their day,
then throw them into a volume under some such title as this,
&ldquo;Specimens of the Ancient Poetry of different
Nations.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have for some time had a project of this
kind, and, with a view to it, I am exciting several of my friends
to contribute their share.&nbsp; Such a work might fill up two
neat pocket volumes.&nbsp; Besides the Erse Poetry, the Rune
Poetry, and some Chinese Poetry, that was published last winter,
at the end of a book called &ldquo;Han Kirn Choaan,&rdquo; or the
Pleasing History, 4 vols.,&mdash;besides these, I have procured a
MS. translation of the &ldquo;Tagrai Carmen,&rdquo; from the
Arabic; and have set a friend to translate Solomon&rsquo;s Song
afresh from the Hebrew, with a view to the Poetry.&nbsp; This
also is printing off, and will soon be published in a shilling
pamphlet.&nbsp; Then I have myself gleaned up specimens of East
Indian Poetry, Peruvian Poetry, Lapland Poetry, Greenland Poetry;
and inclosed I send you a specimen of Saxon Poetry.&nbsp; The
subject is a victory gained by the Anglo-Saxon, Athelstan, over
the Dane Anlafe and his confederate Constantius King of
Scotland.&nbsp; If you compare it with the Runic Ode of Regner
Lodbrog, you will see a remarkable affinity between them, some of
the phrases and imagery being common to both, as the play of
arms, &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; The Latin version falls from the pen
of my very learned friend Mr. Lye, who has made many important
emendations in the original.&nbsp; The English was a slight
attempt of my own, to see if one could not throw a little spirit
into a literal interlineary version, but I have no reason to
boast of my success.&nbsp; I believe the best way would be to
publish the English by itself, like the Runic Odes, and throw the
two columns of Latin and Saxon to the end.&nbsp; Give me your
opinion of my proposal, with regard to the various specimens
mentioned above, and the share I would recommend to yourself in
particular.&nbsp; Be pleased also to return my Saxon Ode, when
perused, for I have kept no copy.</p>
<p><!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>I suppose you have no British Poetry extant, that was
written before the conversion to Christianity, as we have of the
Runic, and as they affect to have of the Erse; if not, then the
most ancient you have is to be chosen.&nbsp; Could not you give
some of the Poetry of Taliesin and Merddin?&nbsp; I must observe
one thing, that your Odes will require a few explanatory Notes,
chiefly with regard to the proper names; and, if you would not
think it too great an innovation, I could wish you would
accommodate some of your ancient British names somewhat more to
our English pronunciation.&nbsp; This is what the Erse translator
has done, and, I think, with great judgment.&nbsp; The word might
be a little smoothed and liquidated in the text, and the original
spelling retained in the margin.&nbsp; Thus Macpherson has
converted Lambhdearg into Lamderg, Geolchopack (a woman&rsquo;s
name) into the soft word Gealcossa, &amp;c.&nbsp; This is a
liberty assumed in all languages; and indeed, without it, it
would not be possible for the inhabitants of one nation to
pronounce the proper names of another.</p>
<p>You tell me you have read Bartholinus&rsquo;s book of Danish
Antiquities; it is a most excellent performance.&nbsp; There is a
celebrated Frenchman, the Chevalier Mallet, historiographer to
the present King of Denmark, who has lately published a work in
French on the same subject, at the end of which he has given a
French translation of the famous Edda or Alcoran (if you suffer
me to use the word) of the ancient Teutonic nations.&nbsp; If I
have health and leisure, I intend to translate this book into
English, though it is a formidable undertaking, being a quarto of
no small size.&nbsp; I have got the book, which is a capital
performance.</p>
<p>I should have one advantage over most others for such an
attempt, which is, that my learned neighbour, Mr. Lye, has got
the Islandic original of the Edda, and would compare my version
with it.&nbsp; I have one thing still to mention, and then I have
done.&nbsp; I have lately been employed in a small literary
controversy with a learned friend, about the original and
antiquity of the popular notion concerning Fairies and
Goblins.&nbsp; My friend is for fetching that whimsical opinion
from the East, so late as the time of the Crusades, and derives
the words Elf and Goblin from the Guelfe and Gibbeline factions
in Italy.&nbsp; But I think it would be impossible for notions so
arbitrary to have obtained so universally, so uniformly, and so
early (see Chaucer&rsquo;s Wife of Bath&rsquo;s Tale), if they
had not got possession of the minds of men many ages
before.&nbsp; Nay, I make no doubt but Fairies are derived from
the <i>Daergar</i> or Dwarfs, whose existence was so generally
believed among all the northern nations.&nbsp; Can you, from any
of your ancient British writers, enable me to ascertain any of
these disputed points, or any resemblance to the name of Fairy,
Elf, Goblin, in your language?&nbsp; I should think, that these
popular superstitions are aboriginal in the island, and are
remains of the ancient Pagan creed.&nbsp; Favour me with your
opinion on this subject when you write next, which, as your
letters are so extremely curious and fraught with entertainment,
I beg may be soon.</p>

<p>I received your obliging letter, which is so curious, that I
cannot but request the repetition of such valuable favours.&nbsp;
I am going to draw up a short Essay on the origin and progress of
our English poetry, in which I shall have occasion to be very
particular in my account of our metrical Romances; and, as I
believe many of these are drawn from old British fables, if not
downright translations from the ancient British language, I
should be extremely obliged to you, if you would give the titles,
and, if possible, a short account of the <!-- page 167--><a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>subjects,
of all such Romances, as are contained in the vellum manuscript,
which you mention, or any other, which you may remember to have
seen.&nbsp; I have a notion, that we have many of them translated
into English and thence into French and other southern
languages.</p>
<p>Inclosed I send you a little Essay on the origin &amp;c. of
the English drama.&nbsp; Bishop Warburton has handled the subject
before me in the 5th vol. of his Shakespeare; but, as he derives
all his information from the French critics, and his instances
from the French stage, you will conclude, that he is often wide
of the mark and generally superficial.&nbsp; Yet he has one
extract from Carew&rsquo;s Survey of Cornwall, relating to the
old Cornish plays, which I recommend to your notice; because I
could wish to know, (not now, but at any future leisure,) whether
you have any thing similar in Wales.&nbsp; The passage from Carew
is this.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Guary Miracle, in English,
Miracle-Play, is a kind of interlude compiled, in Cornish, out of
some scripture history.&nbsp; For representing this they raise an
earthen amphitheatre, in some open field, having the diameter of
this inclosed plain some 40 or 50 feet.&nbsp; The country people
flock from all sides to see and hear it: for they have therein
devils and devices to delight as well the eye as the ear.&nbsp;
The players conne not their parts without books, but are more
prompted by one called the Ordinary, who followeth at their
heels, with the book in his hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; In an act of
Parliament, 4th Hen. IV., mention is made of certain
<i>Wastours</i>, Master Rimours (Rimers) and Minstrels, who
infested the land of Wales, to make commorths or gatherings upon
the people there.&nbsp; Query the meaning of this?&nbsp; I am
afraid, lest I should be too troublesome with my queries, and,
therefore, reserve what you please to answer at any future hour;
only send me an account of your romances now, which will oblige,
dear Sir, your affectionate and faithful servant,</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<h4>The same to the same.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I have been many months indebted to you for a very obliging
letter.&nbsp; I delayed to answer it, in expectation of seeing
your curious Specimens of the Ancient British Poetry, advertised,
from the press before this time.&nbsp; Permit me to enquire, what
forwardness that intended publication (which you gave me hopes in
your last of seeing speedily printed) is in?&nbsp; From the
translations, you have already favoured me with a sight of, I
conceive a very favourable idea of the merits of your ancient
bards, and should be sorry to have their precious relics
swallowed up and lost, in the gulph of time; a danger which they
will incur, if you, that are so well acquainted with their
beauties, and so capable of making them understood by others,
neglect this opportunity of preserving them.&nbsp; I can readily
conceive that many of their most beautiful peculiarities cannot
possibly be translated into another language, but even through
the medium of a prose translation one can discern a rich vein of
poetry, and even classical correctness, infinitely superior to
any other compositions of that age, that we are acquainted
with.&nbsp; Certain I am, that our own nation, at that time,
produced nothing that wears the most distant resemblance to their
merit.</p>
<p>I have lately been collecting specimens of English poetry,
through every age, from the time of the Saxons, down to that of
Elizabeth, and am ashamed to show you what wretched stuff our
rhimers produced at the same time that your bards were
celebrating the praise of Llewelyn with a spirit scarce inferior
to Pindar.&nbsp; Inclosed I send you a specimen of an Elegy on
the death of Edward I.&mdash;that cruel Edward, who made such
havoc among the Cambrian poets.&nbsp; I know not whether you will
be able to decipher these foul scrawls or distinguish them from
the marginal explications, with which I have accompanied
them.&nbsp; <!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>But you will see enough to be
convinced of the infinite superiority of your own bards; nor do I
know, that any of the nations of the continent (unless perchance
Italy, which now about began to be honoured by Dante) were able
at that time to write better than the English.&nbsp; The French,
I am well assured, were not.&nbsp; One thing is observable in the
Elegy on Edward the First, which is, that the poet, in order to
do the more honour to his hero, puts his eulogium in the mouth of
the Pope, with the same kind of fiction as a modern bard would
have raised up Britannia or the genius of Europe, sounding forth
his praises.&nbsp; Considering the destruction which our
merciless monarch made among the last sons of ancient genius, it
may be looked upon as a just judgment upon him, that he had no
better than these miserable rhimes to disgrace his memory.</p>
<p>With regard to your Specimens, should they not yet be put to
the press, I should take it for a great favour if you would
indulge me with a sight of them in MS., or at least the
Dissertation to be prefixed to them; an indulgence that would not
be abused, and which, under whatever restrictions you please,
would oblige, dear Sir,</p>

<p>It is with pleasure I perform all your requests: inclosed you
have the transcript from Wormius which you desired.&nbsp; As his
book relates only to the Runic letters and ancient manner of
writing, it did not fall within his subject professedly to treat
of the Islandic prosody; he has, therefore, only described one
species of verse out of innumerable others, and this, as it were,
by the bye and by way of specimen.&nbsp; He refers to the
<i>Edda</i>, or old Islandic book of prosody, for the rest; this
book I have not seen.&mdash;There is another <i>Edda</i>, which I
have, that explains the Islandic mythology, and of this I shall
publish, ere long, a translation, with some curious notes and
dissertations of <i>M. Mallet</i>, the present historiographer to
the King of Denmark, as you may remember I have hinted in the
preface to my specimens of Runic Poetry.</p>

expectations of your manner of handling it.&nbsp; I thank you for
your friend&rsquo;s preface; though he is not much master of
English style, the particulars he produces are curious.&nbsp; I
have turned to my learned friend Mr. Lye&rsquo;s edition of
<i>Junii Etymologicon Anglicanum</i> for the etymology of such
words as your friend mentions, and I find nothing, that does not
confirm his derivations; I have not time now to descend to
particulars, but shall be glad to hear from you as soon as
agreeable.&nbsp; One so much master, as you are, of British

<p>P.S.&nbsp; Pray, are the Welsh romances, you have described,
in prose or verse?&nbsp; If they are in prose, then let me ask if
you have ever seen any in verse?&nbsp; I take it, these subjects
were treated in verse before they came to plain prose in most
nations.&nbsp; This, at least, I find to be the case in the old
Erse and Islandic languages, as well as in the more modern
Italian, French, Spanish, and English tongues.&nbsp; I have got
curious specimens in the last I mentioned.&nbsp; Pray is the word

<p class="gutsumm">It appears that the Rev. E. Evans (<i>Ieuan
Prydydd Hir</i>), had prepared for publication a Collection of
our Ancient Welsh Proverbs; for a writer in the second volume of
the &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Cambro Briton</span>,&rdquo; gives
the following translation of the Latin Preface preffixed to the
MSS., which we here reprint.</p>
<p>Having discovered Dr. Davies of Mallwyd&rsquo;s Latin
Translation of our Welsh Proverbs among many other ancient MSS.
in the library at Llanvorda, and soon after having found, also
the original, from which his was transcribed, among the same
valuable collection, I thought I could not undertake a more
useful work to my country, than to publish the same, and dedicate
it, as the first fruits of my labours, to my munificent patron,
Sir W. W. Wynn.&nbsp; The exact time when that ancient bard and
philosopher, called by the Welsh <i>Hen Gyrys o I&acirc;l</i>,
flourished, cannot be accurately ascertained.&nbsp; Two
collections of Proverbs, made by him, and written on parchment,
are now extant in the above library, and, at the end of the said
book, a fair copy of Hywel Dda&rsquo;s laws; and from the best
judgment, which can be formed from the appearance of the said
MSS. and the mode of writing, or form of the hand, it may with
safety be pronounced to be about five hundred years old.&nbsp; To
the former of these two collections is annexed the following note
respecting the author: &ldquo;Mabieith Hen Gyrys o I&acirc;l, yr

district, containing five parishes, situated towards the
north-east corner of the county of Denbigh; and Buddigre, where
he lived, is near, if not within, the limits of the parish of
Bryn Eglwys.&nbsp; It is evident, that this collection of
Proverbs was made from various works of a great number of old
bards, living in different ages; for many of them are taken from
the compositions of Llywarch Hen (Llywarch the Aged), and from
the poems of Aneurin and Taliesin, and several from those of
other bards much more ancient, whose effusions have unfortunately
perished.</p>
<p>It is more than probable, that many of these pithy sentences
and proverbial sayings, these aphorisms of wisdom and axioms of
prudence, were the productions of the venerable Druids; and they
exhibit, in the present imperfect form, in which they have been
delivered to us, no despicable specimens of those verses
mentioned by C&aelig;sar, in the seemingly enigmatical mysteries
of which their pupils were initiated, and spent many years in
acquiring and committing them to memory.&nbsp; And he farther
informs us, that, notwithstanding these learned sages made use of
Greek characters in transacting both their public and private
affairs, yet their disciples were not permitted to <i>write</i>
these verses, principally, (as it appeared to him,) for two
reasons; in the first place, because, if they were allowed to do
so, the mysteries of their profession would soon be divulged:
and, secondly, if these aphorisms were committed to writing, the
noviciates, confiding in such artificial aids, would no longer be
at the pains of sufficiently exercising their memories.&nbsp;
Many of these poetical proverbs are composed in that peculiar
kind of metre, which is distinguished by the name of <i>Englyn
Milwr</i>, and these verses are possessed of such strong internal
marks of antiquity, that I may with safety pronounce them to be
the genuine productions of the Druids.&nbsp; And, as they are by
no means unworthy of being considered as the real effusions of
those learned sages and philosophers, it will not, I hope, be
deemed a digression, or by any means irrelevant to the object of
this introduction, to gratify the reader with a specimen of one
of these oracular compositions, together with a close literal
Latin version.&nbsp; The first two lines of these poetical <!--
page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>triplets seem to contain some of the privileges of the
Druids, and the third generally exhibits some maxim of wisdom or
axiom of prudence.&nbsp; The following were transcribed from the
Red Book of Hergest, in the library of Jesus College,
Oxford:&mdash;</p>

<p>The foregoing stanzas, as well as many others of the same
description, are still extant is the above mentioned book, called
Llyfr Coch o Hergest, and likewise in several MSS. in the
libraries of Llanvorda near Oswestry, and Hengwrt near Dolgellau;
and, on account of their having accidentally been discovered
among the compositions of that ancient bard Llywarch Hen, Dr.
Davies and Edw. Llwyd have hastily and inconsiderately pronounced
them to be some of his productions; but the frequent recurrence
of the oak, their favourite tree, and the dark allusions to the
druidical rites and privileges, most evidently and convincingly,
(in my opinion,) denote their origin to be from that
source.&nbsp; But here it may be objected, that the Druids could
not, (as C&aelig;sar declares it was not their usual practice,)
have committed these verses to writing.&nbsp; Granted it was so
in his time; yet it is manifest from the poems of our celebrated
bard Taliesin, that, in subsequent times, they did not strictly
adhere to this resolution; for many of their pretended mysteries
are divulged in his compositions.&nbsp; It is also evident, that,
in these early ages, the Druids were not the only persons, who
were thus cautious of revealing their secrets to the vulgar; but
the Bards also endeavoured to conceal their poetical rules and
metres, from the public; for their book of prosody, containing
the intricacies of the art, is distinguished by the name of
<i>Cyfrinach y Beirdd</i>, (i.e. The Secret of the Bards,) and
they were strictly prohibited from explaining these, except to
their own noviciate disciples, which continued to be their
practice nearly to our own times.&nbsp; But, notwithstanding
these strict prohibitions, it is well known, that the poetical
compositions of the bards were publicly recited; and it is
evident that, after the commencement of the Christian &aelig;ra,
the Druids were not so scrupulously cautious with respect to
these rules of secrecy, which may be proved from some stanzas,
which I have seen in an ancient MS., denominated <i>Englynion
Duad</i>, probably from a bard or druid of that name.&nbsp; Some
few of the lines I shall here subjoin, for the inspection of the
reader.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bid gogor gan i&acirc;r,<br />
Bid gan lew drydar,<br />
Bid oval ar a&rsquo;i c&acirc;r;<br />
Bid t&ograve;n calon gan alar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These lines have been introduced into our Welsh proverbs; and
the following remark is made on them at the end of Dr.
Davies&rsquo;s MS. copy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Gwyl y rhagor y sydd rhwng y rhai hyn ar rhai
sydd yn Llyfr Coch, a hen gopiau eraill; a gwybydd fod y gerdd
hon yn hen iawn; gan fod cymmaint o ymrafael rhwng yr hen
gopiau.&rdquo;&nbsp; i.e. Advertat lector qu&agrave;m variant
inter se exemplar Hergestianum et alia exemplaria in hoc cantico,
et sciat, hoc carmen ob differentias pr&aelig;dictas esse
vetustissimum.</p>
<p>Those learned men are, therefore, mistaken, who suppose, that
the Druids never committed any of their compositions to writing;
when it is evident, that these and others of their productions
have been conveyed down to us.&nbsp; Taliesin, as I have before
hinted, informs us, <!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>that he was instructed by them in
many of their mysteries, particularly in that of the
&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&epsilon;&mu;&psi;&upsilon;&chi;&omega;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;,
and in many other rudiments of their philosophy.&nbsp; And hence
it is, that his works are more obscure than those of any other of
the ancient bards.</p>
<p>There is also a certain degree of obscurity in the very words
and language of Taliesin; and the same may be observed of the
compositions of Aneurin Gwawdrydd and other bards of the same
age, a catalogue of whose works may be found in the learned
Edward Llwyd&rsquo;s Arch&aelig;ology, collected from the notes
of William Maurice, Esq., of Cefn y Braich.&nbsp; But Mr. E.
Llwyd never saw any of the poetical compositions of Taliesin,
Aneurin, and other early bards, except those of Llywarch Hen,
which he found in <i>Llyfr Coch o Hergest</i>: and the works of
these ancient authors will afford us very material assistance,
not only in the investigation of our ancient British language,
but also in examining historical facts, and in tracing the origin
of the various tribes, who inhabited this island during that
early period.&nbsp; Taliesin, in a poem, of which the following
is the title, &ldquo;<i>Cerdd am Feibion Llyr ap Brychwel
Powys</i>,&rdquo; mentions three separate nations, who had taken
possession of different parts of Britain, previous to his time,
viz., <i>Gwyddyl</i> (Celts or Gauls,) <i>Brython</i>, and
<i>Romani</i>, (Romans.)</p>
<blockquote><p>Gwyddyl, a Brython, a Romani,<br />
A wna hon dyhedd, a dyfysci;<br />
Ac am derfyn Prydein, cain ei threfi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they are represented as exciting war and tumult on the
borders of this fair isle, and its beautiful towns and cities;
and it appears evidently from this poem, that the first
inhabitants were <i>Gwyddyl</i> or Celts, which circumstance Mr.
Llwyd and others have proved most satisfactorily, from the names
of mountains, rivers, &amp;c.&nbsp; But by the word
<i>Gwyddyl</i> Taliesin must, by no means, be understood to mean
the modern Irish; for their language at present contains a very
considerable mixture of Cantabrian and Spanish, and differs very
materially from the ancient genuine Celtic and British, which
clearly appears from the writings of the old bards, and the
ancient British Proverbs.&nbsp; For, if any person were vain
enough to suppose, that he could discover the meaning of some of
our obsolete British words, by consulting an Irish Dictionary, he
would soon find himself woefully disappointed, and I am clearly
of opinion, that the ancient genuine Celtic dialect had a very
near affinity to the old Welsh or British.&nbsp; I believe, that
the persons, denominated <i>Gwyddyl</i> by Taliesin, were genuine
Celt&aelig;, and inhabited this island previous to the arrival of
the Britons, and probably soon after the general deluge, and that
these Celt&aelig; were the progeny of the Titans; for the Curetes
and Corybantes, who were their princes and nobles, are clearly
identified with the <i>Cowri</i> of the British history, written
by Tyssilio (the bishop), which Geoffrey of Monmouth has very
improperly translated <i>Giants</i>.&nbsp; And this blunder of
his has been the source of endless mistakes; for the word
<i>Cowri</i> evidently means princes, generals, nobles, or
persons of great eminence.&nbsp; The Curetes are therefore our
<i>Cowri</i>; and the Corybantes (i.e. <i>Cowri-Bann</i>) were
princes or persons of great eminence, as the expression denotes;
and, what is still more to our purpose, the word gwyddyl also
implies any thing conspicuous, and is nearly synonymous with
<i>Cowri</i>, which is the usual term, even to the present day,
to designate persons of uncommon stature or great bodily
strength.&nbsp; The Curetes, therefore, were evidently our Cowri,
and the Corybantes (i.e. <i>Cowri-Bann</i>) imply princes or
leaders, or persons of the most eminent rank and consequence:
and, in order to corroborate this assertion, it may be observed
here, that there is a very high mountain near Towyn, in the
county of Merioneth, which, to this day, bears the name of
<i>Gwyddyl Fynydd</i>; and the highest peak or summit of Snowdon,
is denominated <i>Yr Wyddfa</i>, (i.e. the highest eminence or
the most conspicuous,) and by the common people, even at this
time, is known by no other name.&nbsp; And <i>Gwydd Grug</i>
means a high hill, or eminence; <i>Gwydd Fryniau</i>, high banks;
and <i>Trum Gwydd</i>, the ridge of a mountain; and many others,
which it would be tedious and useless to enumerate.&nbsp; And it
may also be observed here, that the
&Kappa;&epsilon;&lambda;&tau;&alpha;&iota; and
&Gamma;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&iota; of the Greeks,
and the <i>Celt&aelig; </i>and <i>Galli</i>, of the Latins,
appear to me to bear no other import.&nbsp; For <i>Gallt</i> and
<i>Allt</i> are clearly synonymous with <i>Gwyddel</i>, and
denote any thing high or eminent, though the word <i>Gallt</i>
is, at present, restricted to designate the steep ascent of a
hill, or a <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>declivity; but, that the word Gallt
was anciently used to denominate high mountains may be justly
inferred from the word <i>Alps</i>, which is evidently composed
of two Celtic words, Gallt-ban, or pen, i.e. Allt-ban, Al-pen, or
Alpine, which commutation or change of initial letters will
appear easy to any person acquainted with the British language,
and perfectly justified by the rules of grammar, as the mutations
of radical letters in Welsh are well known to be nearly
endless.&nbsp; It would not be difficult to prove, that the
ancient Britons are descendants of the Celt&aelig;, and a close
connection and affinity may be traced between their language not
with the ancient Celtic only but also with the Greek; and, it is
at the same time very evident, that their dialect differed
materially from that of the aboriginal inhabitants of this
island, and whom on that account they denominated <i>Gaillt</i>
and <i>Gwyddyl</i>.&nbsp; The British language retains to this
day many words purely Greek, such as <i>Haul</i>,
&Eta;&lambda;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;, the sun, <i>Dwfr</i>,
&Upsilon;&delta;&omega;&rho;, water, and many others, which have
been pointed out some time by the learned <i>Pezron</i>.&nbsp;
But, that the Britons had other words of the same import purely
Celtic may be proved from the works of the ancient bards; for
<i>huan</i> is made use of by Iorwerth Vychan, and many other
bards, to signify the <i>sun</i>,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Llewyrch ebyr myr, morfeydd dylan;<br />
Pan lewych <i>huan</i> ar fann fynydd.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Iorwerth Vychan</i>.</p>
<p>Coruscatio portuum aquarum, et paludum marinarum;<br />
Cum sol splendet ab excelso monte.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the old bard, <i>Avan Verddig</i>, in his elegy on the
death of Cadwallon, the son of Cadvan, makes use of
<i>b&ecirc;r</i> for water, instead of <i>dwr</i> or
<i>dwfr</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Goluchav glew, hael, hilig N&acirc;v
N&ecirc;r,<br />
Aded gynt, ettiynt, hyd yn <i>irfer</i> hallt.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Avan Verddig</i>.</p>
<p>Exorabo potentem et liberalem Dominum Creatorem,<br />
Iverunt ad madidam aquam salsam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from hence it is manifest, that <i>huan</i> and
<i>b&ecirc;r</i> are two ancient Celtic words; but, if any one
were to consult an Irish lexicon in hopes of finding the
expressions, he would be disappointed; yet he may discover
<i>bir</i> among the obsolete words in that language.&nbsp; The
names of moors, meadows, and rivers, in different parts of Wales,
may also be produced as an additional evidence that <i>ber</i>
and <i>mer</i> originally signified water,&mdash;for instance,
<i>Bereu Derwenydd</i>, near Snowdon, <i>Castell y Berau</i>, in
Llanfihangel y Pennant, in Merionethshire, where many mountain
torrents meet.&nbsp; <i>Aber</i>, a confluence, seems also to
justify this opinion, and <i>inver</i>, in the Erse dialect.</p>

<p>Lo, to the jocund Bard, here&rsquo;s a barren summer; to the
Bard the world is desolate.</p>
<p>How is Venedotia bereft of its bright luminary?&nbsp; How its
heaven is enveloped with darkness, ever since the full moon of
beauty has been laid in the silent tomb!&nbsp; Mournful deed! a
lovely Fair, in the oaken chest; my speech can find no utterance
since thou art gone, O thou of shape divine!&nbsp; Lamp of
Venedotia; how long hast thou been confined in the gloomy
grave!&nbsp; Arise, thou that art dearer to me than life; open
the dismal door of thine earthly cell!&nbsp; Leave, O fair one,
thy sandy bed; shine upon the face of thy lover.&nbsp; Here by
the tomb, generous maid of noble descent, stands one whose
mirthful days are past, whose countenance is pale with the loss
of thee; even Llewelyn Goch, the celebrater of thy praise, pining
<!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>for the love of thee, helpless and forlorn, unequal to
the task of song.</p>
<p>I heard, O thou that art confined in the deep and dismal
grave, nought out of thy lips but truth, my speechless
Fair!&nbsp; Nought, O thou of stately growth, fairest of virgins
fair!&nbsp; But thou hadst promised, now unfeeling to the pangs
of love, to stay till I came from South Wales; lovely
silk-shrouded maid!&nbsp; The false Destinies snatched thee out
of my sight; it nought concerns me to be exposed to the stormy
winds, since the agreement between thee and pensive me is
void!&nbsp; Thou! thou! lovely maid, wert true; I, even I was
false; and now fruitlessly bemoan!&nbsp; From henceforth I will
bid adieu to fair Venedotia.&nbsp; It concerns me not whither I
go.&nbsp; I must forego my native soil for a virtuous maid, where
it were my happiness to live, were she alive!&nbsp; O thou whose
angelic face was become a proverb; thy beauty is laid low in the
lonesome tomb!&nbsp; The whole world without thee is nothing,
such anguish do I suffer!&nbsp; I, thy pensive Bard, ramble in
distress, bewailing the loss of thee, illustrious maid!&nbsp;
Where, O where shall I see thee, thou of form divine, bright as
the full moon!&nbsp; Is it on the Mount of Olives, loveliest of
women?&nbsp; Ovid&rsquo;s love was nothing in comparison of mine,
lovely Lleucu; thy form was worthy of heaven, and my voice hath
failed in invoking thy name.&nbsp; Alas! woe is me, fair maid of
Pennal.&nbsp; It sounded as a dream to me, to hear that thy
charms were laid in the dust; and those lips which I oft have
praised, excelled the utmost efforts of my Muse.&nbsp; O my soul,
whiter than the foam of the rapid streams, my love, I have now
the heavy task of composing thy Elegy.</p>
<p>Lovely virgin!&nbsp; How are thy bright shining eyes closed in
everlasting sleep in the stony tomb!&nbsp; Arise to thy pensive
Bard, who can smile no more, were he possessed <!-- page 175--><a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>of a
kingdom; arise in thy silken vest, lift up thy countenance from
the dismal grave!</p>
<p>I tell no untruth, my feet are benumbed by walking around thy
dwelling place, O Lleucu Llwyd, where heretofore, bright lamp of
Venedotia, I was wont to celebrate thy beauty in fine flowing
verse, where I was wont to be merry in praising thy delicate hand
and tapering fingers, ornamented with rings of gold, lovely
Lleucu, delicate sweet-tempered Lleucu!&nbsp; Thou wert far more
precious than reliques to me!&nbsp; The soul of the darling of
Meirionydd is gone up to God, its original Author, and her fair
corpse is deposited in the sanctuary of holy ground, far, far
from me in the silent tomb!&nbsp; The treasure of the world is
left in the custody of a haughty black man.&nbsp; Longing and
melancholy dirges are the portion of my lot.&nbsp; I lament with
faltering accents over the lovely Lleucu! whiter than the flakes
of riven snow.&nbsp; Yesterday I poured down my cheeks showers of
tears over thy tomb.&nbsp; The fountains of my head are dry, my
eyes are strangers to sleep, since thou art gone; thou
fair-formed speechless maid hast not deigned to answer thy
weeping Bard.&nbsp; How I lament, alas, that earth and stones
should cover thy lovely face; alas that the tomb should be made
so fast, that dust should ever cover the paragon of beauty, that
stony walls and coffin should separate thee and me, that the
earth should lock thee fast in her bosom, that a shroud should
enclose a beauty that rivalled the dawn of the morn; alas that
strong doors, bolts, and stately locks should divide us for
ever!</p>

class="pagenum">p. 181</span>THE FEUDAL SYSTEM.<br />
<span class="smcap">by</span><br />
JOHN JENKINS, <span class="smcap">Esq.</span></h2>
<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>[As much of the proceeding Work relates to Feudal times and
usages, the following able Paper from the pen of a modern writer
cannot be otherwise than acceptable to the reader.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>
<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A clear idea of the Feudal System is in the highest degree
interesting to the inhabitants of modern Europe, as it was the
first form of society which succeeded ancient civilization, and
is the foundation of most of our modern laws, systems, and
institutions.&nbsp; Without a definite idea of this system, much
or most of the present regulations of civilized life would be
unintelligible.</p>
<p>But I have spoken of ancient civilization.&nbsp; What did this
term mean?&nbsp; What does it comprise?&nbsp; I believe, it means
that progressive or advancing state of human society, which
existed among the various nations and empires of the world
previous to the dissolution of the Roman Empire.&nbsp; The
countries where this civilization reached its highest stage are
well-known.&nbsp; History presents them in bold relief on its
pages.&nbsp; They were Persia, Assyria, Chaldea, Egypt, Greece,
and Rome; and, in an inferior degree, China and Hindoostan.&nbsp;
In these countries the inhabitants had substituted a stationary
for a wandering life, had acquired the notions and defined the
limits and rights of property, had entered the bonds and enjoyed
the benefits of society, had extended their ideas beyond
supplying the rude necessities of life, had acquired a taste for
the comforts and even luxuries of social life, <!-- page 182--><a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>had begun
to cultivate the arts and sciences, had built vessels whereby
they could traffic by sea, and had erected towns and cities (some
of costly magnificence) on land.&nbsp; The bulk of the people had
forsaken the sword for the plough, and exchanged the spear for
the pruning-hook.&nbsp; They dwelt peaceably and securely in
their villages, towns, and rural homes.&nbsp; They divided their
employments.&nbsp; The land was cultivated, the stock of living
animals was fed, and commerce carried on.&nbsp; A parliament or
congress of the chief inhabitants assembled, and deliberated on
the affairs of State.&nbsp; Laws were enacted, and justice
administered in the public courts.&nbsp; The spiritual interests
of the people were also provided for, and magnificent temples,
churches, and cathedrals were built and adorned the land.&nbsp; A
regular gradation of nobles or chiefs was established, to whom
the people at large looked up, while a King, Sovereign, or
Emperor governed the whole.&nbsp; These are the leading ideas
connected with ancient civilization.&nbsp; These elements
flourished largely in the last of the old empires, or that of
Rome, which before its fall had transcended all that went before
in commerce, civilization, learning, refinement, science, art, as
well as in grandeur and extent of territory.</p>
<p>We have spoken of the fall of the Roman Empire.&nbsp; This
occurred in the beginning of the fifth century.&nbsp; We will
just glance at the state of Europe immediately before the
dissolution of that vast empire.&nbsp; The Roman Empire (which
comprised Italy and the adjacent territories) was at that time
and had been for centuries the only kingdom in Europe where the
arts of peace and civilization reigned.&nbsp; All the vast
countries north of the Alps, west of the Mediterranean, and east
and north of the Adriatic seas, were in a state of comparative,
if not complete barbarism.&nbsp; Among the people who inhabited
these countries we may name the Franks, who occupied Gallia or
modern France; <!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>the Goths, Vandals, and Germanic
tribes, who occupied modern Germany; the Scythians and other
Sclavonic races who occupied modern Russia; the Visigoths, who
occupied Spain; the Celts, who dwelt in Great Britain and
Ireland; and the Scandinavians, who occupied the north of Europe,
or Lapland, Sweden, and Norway.&nbsp; These various populations
were, during the zenith, and down to the fall of the Roman
Empire, in a state of semi if not perfect barbarism.&nbsp; A
great portion of them were nomadic or roving tribes, and had in
their career of devastation and conquest traversed the vast
plains of Asia and eastern Europe, before taking up a more
settled though not permanent abode in the broad plains and
forests of Germany, Spain, and Russia.&nbsp; The Goths,
Scythians, and Sclavonic tribes who thus poured into Europe, were
emigrants from Asia.&nbsp; The native races who inhabited eastern
Europe were unequal to repel the savage invasions of these
formidable marauders, who inundated Europe with their fierce and
unsettled bands.&nbsp; If we may credit the account given of
these tribes by the Roman writers of the period, their manners
were savage, their habits of life simple, but of a roving and
predatory character.&nbsp; By the Roman historians they are
invariably styled&mdash;the Barbarians.&nbsp; They cultivated not
commerce, they built not cities, they dwelt not in luxurious
towns.&nbsp; Their abode was the vast forest or plain, their
occupation hunting and war, their food the produce of the chase
or the plunder of war, their dress the skins of beasts and
articles of the rudest manufacture.&nbsp; Yet in their spirit was
energy, in their hearts a love of conquest and
aggrandisement.&nbsp; After having for ages in vain withstood the
conquering arms of Julius C&aelig;sar and other Roman commanders,
they in turn became the assailants.&nbsp; After the reign of
Augustus C&aelig;sar the military spirit of the Romans decayed
their energy declined, their ambition was lost.&nbsp; The chief
people surrendered themselves to all the enervating effects <!--
page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>of pleasure and luxury.&nbsp; No valorous chief led the
army in the field, no Cato or Tully thundered alarm in the
Capitol, to summon the inhabitants to glory or even
defence:&mdash;they were rather found revelling in riot and
debauchery at home.&nbsp; No Pompey governed in Spain; no Sallust
was Pr&aelig;tor in Numidia.&nbsp; The race of the wise and
mighty had departed.&nbsp; The infection had reached the common
people, who were equally given up to indolence, license, riot,
debauchery, and sloth.&nbsp; In this state was Rome and the
Romans, when the barbarians rose in the north under Alaric, King
or Chief of the Goths, descended the Alps with the rapidity and
force of the avalanche, overthrew the empire, and possessed
Rome.&nbsp; Then was presented a scene the most unexampled the
world ever beheld.&nbsp; The chief or warrior who a few months
before held his counsels in a hut or wigwam on the banks of the
Danube or Rhine, was seated on the throne of the
C&aelig;sars&mdash;the herdsman of the forest inhabited the
palaces of Rome.&nbsp; The savage hid himself in the fine linen
of the Roman citizen&mdash;the barbarian covered himself with
patrician gold.&nbsp; The effeminate luxury of the Empire had
yielded all to the insatiate energy and ambition of the
North.</p>
<p>But even the nomadic tribes of central Europe found the
miseries and inconveniences of a wandering and predatory
life.&nbsp; The Saxons, Goths, and Scythians experienced the
comforts and enjoyments of a settled and stationary life.&nbsp;
They even grew weary of conquest, and knew the hazard of warlike
achievements.&nbsp; They therefore wished to settle down upon
some fixed and definite territory.&nbsp; They determined to
appropriate a place which they could call their home, and to
inhabit a country which they could call their own.&nbsp; They saw
the precarious subsistence which awaited those who depended on
the spontaneous produce of the earth, and the greater riches
which would <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>accrue from a cultivation of the
soil.&nbsp; They therefore resolved on a stationary life.&nbsp;
But this new life must have order and laws.&nbsp; There must be a
Head to whom they should look up, a law or rule which they should
obey.&nbsp; The warrior or chief under whose guidance the tribe
had conquered and become powerful, was chosen Head of the
community, and Lord paramount of the soil.&nbsp; The lesser
warriors or captains were placed next in degree and power.&nbsp;
The people at large were in a state of vassalage and dependence
upon the Lord paramount and his Esquires and Deputies.&nbsp; The
Lord paramount built and fortified a castle on some eligible spot
in the domain.&nbsp; This castle was used for the residence of
the Lord and his family in time of peace, and for the hospitable
reception of his retainers and dependents.&nbsp; But in time of
war the castle was the refuge and resort of all the inhabitants
of the domain.&nbsp; There they retired before the superior
number or power of the enemy, and were generally safe.&nbsp;
Thence arose the rights and duties of chief and people.&nbsp; The
chief owed to the people protection and security from foreign
enemies, as well as arbitration and counsel.&nbsp; The people on
the other hand owed the Lord suit and service in time of war to
repel the common enemy, and allegiance at all times.&nbsp; For
these purposes in time of peace the vassals or people farmed and
cultivated the domain for their own benefit, paying to the Lord
rent, suit, and service.&nbsp; The Lord reserved for his own use
a large tract in the vicinity of his castle.&nbsp; Should any
dispute arise between the tenants or vassals respecting the
ownership or cultivation of their respective tracts of the
domain, or otherwise, the Lord was arbiter or judge.&nbsp;
Afterwards and in process of time the Lord called his chief
dependents or vassals to assist him in the arbitrament of his
subjects&rsquo; disputes.&nbsp; These tribunals were subsequently
called the Baron&rsquo;s Court, or Court of the Manor, and were
the only tribunals of justice in the earlier period of the feudal
society.&nbsp; The <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>Lord presided, and was assisted by
his principal tenants or vassals.&nbsp; The Baron or Manorial
Court was of the utmost importance in those rude times, for there
were recorded all the transactions relating to the land within
the manor; and there assembled all the tenants who had rent,
suit, or service to pay or render, or who had complaint to make
of disturbance, injury, or grievance, from a fellow tenant, or
vassal.&nbsp; The decision of this court was final, the
disobedience of which was punished by heavy fines, forfeitures,
and disqualifications.</p>
<p>We thus see that the feudal society arose not more from choice
than from the necessity and circumstances of the time.&nbsp; At
this unsettled and warlike period, protection was required for
the tribe or clan from the enmity or rapacity of neighbouring
hordes.&nbsp; The tribe therefore united under one common chief
to defend their own territory and people, and when necessary, to
make war on a neighbouring or distant community.&nbsp; Rule and
internal government were also necessary for the comfort and
security of the tribe itself.&nbsp; These were therefore the
circumstances which induced, or rather compelled the various
tribes or hordes of the barbarian population of medi&aelig;val
Europe to enter the feudal society.&nbsp; And in this manner
sprung up, soon after the dissolution of the Roman Empire, that
vast net-work of feudal society, which eventually extended itself
from Cape Trafalgar to the Euxine Sea, and from the Gulf of
Bothnia to the Pillars of Hercules.</p>
<p>It was among the vast forests and plains of Russia, Hungary,
Germany, and France, and by a people just emerging from
barbarism, that the feudal system arose, and that about the fifth
century of the Christian era; thence it was carried by the
Continental invaders into their newly conquered
territories.&nbsp; But in no country <!-- page 187--><a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>was the
system more predominant, than in Gaul, or France, whence it was
carried by their Duke of Normandy, or our William the Conqueror,
after the battle of Hastings in the eleventh century into
Britain, and was more rigorously established here for the
protection of the conquerors and the subjection of the native
races than it had ever been in Normandy itself.&nbsp; The
Conqueror parcelled out all the richest parts of the territory
among seven hundred of his Captains or warlike retainers, and
erected each into a Barony.&nbsp; The Barons rented a portion of
their domains to their Knights, which were denominated
knights&rsquo; fiefs, and were 60,215 in number;&mdash;these
again sub-let part of their fiefs to their Esquires.&nbsp; The
cultivation of the soil and all kind of manual labor were carried
on by the vassals, or villeins, who formed the mass of the
people.&nbsp; Each class owed rent, suit, and service to their
superiors, and the whole were subject to the Lord paramount, or
Sovereign, to whom the right to the soil of all the land in his
kingdom was reserved, and the herbage or surface alone was
granted to the Barons and their tenants, on condition of yielding
suit and service to the King, failing which the land reverted to
its original owner&mdash;the Lord paramount.&nbsp; The wily
Conqueror thus founded a superstructure of government which
proved impregnable to all assaults from the vanquished races, and
reared a cordon of despotism strong and compact from within, and
unassailable from without.</p>
<p>The object of this superstructure being military strength,
each Norman Baron erected a stately castle fortified by walls,
towers, and, if available, a moat, on the strongest site or
position within his manor.&nbsp; Here the Baron dwelt, with his
domestics, and a chosen body of his warlike vassals, who always
bore arms, and watched and were prepared by day and by night at
any alarm to sally forth to any summons of conquest or
defence.&nbsp; In times <!-- page 188--><a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>of peace
the chief occupation of the Baron and his principal retainers was
the chase, and the game on the manor was preserved with the
greatest care, and its destruction guarded against by the forest
laws, which were the most cruel of any enactments on record,
inasmuch as the punishment for killing a deer or even a hare was
the taking out the eyes of the delinquent; while at the same time
the punishment of homicide, or murder, was only a small pecuniary
fine, and when perpetrated by the Baron or any of his retainers
on an inferior vassal was seldom enforced.&nbsp; In short, under
this system there was then no appeal or redress by an inferior
for any crime or wrong perpetrated by his superior in rank; and
the vassals, or people at large, were in a state of the greatest
subjection and most abject slavery, inasmuch as the will and
pleasure of the superior liege formed the only law of the
land.</p>
<p>It is certain that the feudal system after the Norman model
never existed among the Saxons in this island, or on the
continent of Europe, previously to the Norman Conquest.&nbsp;
Their Kings were mostly elected to the throne; and the land was
possessed principally by their military chieftains, called
Thanes.&nbsp; This order was at first confined to military
supremacy; but in process of time successful merchants and others
who had acquired wealth were admitted into the rank.&nbsp; The
Thanes resided in large irregular halls upon their estates, in a
coarse but very hospitable manner: their halls were said to be
generally filled with their neighbours and tenants, who spent
their time in feasting and riot.&nbsp; The great distinction
between the Anglo-Saxon nobility and the Norman, according to
William of Malmesbury, was, that the latter built magnificent and
stately castles; whereas the former dwelt in large but mean
houses, and consumed their immense fortunes in riot and
hospitality.&nbsp; Nevertheless this social communion, combined
with the hearty generosity and <!-- page 189--><a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>manners of
the Saxon nobility, made them extremely popular among their
tenants and vassals, between whom was established a spontaneous
and steady attachment.&nbsp; The next in degree were called
Ceorles, and were freemen.&nbsp; These conducted most of the
occupations on the land and in trade;&mdash;they formed the most
numerous class of the Anglo-Saxon population, and enjoyed all the
rights of freemen, as these were understood in those
times;&mdash;they had a voice in the national councils, served on
juries in the County and other Courts, and their rights and
liberties were protected, and generally enforced by fines against
each other, and even against their superiors.&nbsp; The
Anglo-Saxons rejoiced in their system of trial by jury, and
boasted it as their peculiar institution.&nbsp; It was also a law
among them that none should be tried except by his equals in the
government.&nbsp; These institutions, with the historical
open-heartedness of the Thanes and landed proprietors, secured to
the Ceorles or freemen as much of real liberty and justice as
those rude times might admit.</p>
<p>But the Saxon government is defaced by the odious vice of
slavery.&nbsp; The slaves were those whom they had conquered in
battle; and the Anglo-Saxons introduced them into this
island.&nbsp; They were household slaves, performing menial
duties, and predial or rustic slaves who labored on the
soil.&nbsp; The proprietors sold their slaves with their estates,
and they were regarded as chattels: yet the master had not
unlimited power over his slave, for it was ordained that if he
beat out his slave&rsquo;s eye or teeth, he gained his liberty;
and if he killed him, he paid a fine to the King.&nbsp; Yet,
notwithstanding this protection, and although the slaves were
confined to races vanquished in battle, yet the practice formed a
dark stain on the Saxon institutions.</p>
<p>The government of the Ancient Britons, or Cymri, <!-- page
190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>corresponded much with the Anglo-Saxon, except that
their King was hereditary, and that they were always free from
the odious institution of slavery.&nbsp; Sovereign power was
inherited among the Cymri, according to the present rules of
descent in England, from whom it was probably derived.&nbsp; The
chief people were the Princes or large land-proprietors, who
dwelt in magnificent style, and exercised unbounded hospitality
in their halls upon their estates.&nbsp; Here they received their
retainers and tenants, to whom they dispensed the greatest
liberality: here also dwelt the Bards, Priests, and Literati of
the period&mdash;the Taliesins, Aneurins, and Dafydd ap
Gwilyms&mdash;in the enjoyment of the most profuse favors and
protection from their munificent patrons.&nbsp; Hence also the
spontaneous and faithful attachment of the whole to their
Princes,&mdash;as exemplified in the poems of the Bards, and the
warlike records of the Cymric nation.&nbsp; Besides the Princes,
were a large number of independent landowners or Esquires
distributed over the whole island.&nbsp; The great mass of the
people, as in every community, labored on the land, or were
employed in domestic and mercantile occupations.&nbsp; Slavery or
even abject servitude was unknown among them: every class enjoyed
the rights and exercised the privileges of freemen, and seldom
failed in obtaining redress for any crime or wrong.&nbsp; In
their freedom from slavery, and their full enjoyment of civil
rights and immunities, the Cymri of ancient times formed a
striking contrast with all the European nations.</p>
<p>The effects of the Norman Conquest varied altogether as it
respected the Anglo-Saxons and the Cymri.&nbsp; The former were
entirely subjected to the feudal system, and their lands
forfeited and parcelled out among the Norman chiefs.&nbsp; The
forest laws and other odious parts of the feudal system were
executed in all their rigor against the vanquished Saxon: hence
the sanguinary feuds and mortal <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>enmity
which for several centuries existed between the Saxon and Norman
race.&nbsp; The former, repelled by the feudal system from open
war, retaliated by private and secret murders and injuries upon
their Norman oppressors: no Saxon impeaching, the murder or crime
was never discovered, and the perpetrator unpunished.&nbsp; At
length the Normans, being decimated by this practice of stealthy
revenge, passed a law that every Saxon in the parish should
answer for every Norman found killed within its limits.&nbsp;
This law, which would have been rigorously executed, at last
suppressed the Saxon retaliation; nevertheless the hostility
between the two races continued for ages, and was only inflamed
by the contempt and oppression of the Norman on all occasions
evinced.&nbsp; The Cymri on the other hand remained free in their
mountain fastnesses and plains west of the Severn and Dee, and
unaffected by the Norman invasion and conquest.&nbsp; They even
rejoiced at the change, inasmuch as it supplanted a foreign and
adverse race&mdash;the Saxon&mdash;by a kindred and more
congenial people; for the Normans were Celts descended from the
same Cimbric origin, and had many qualities of mind and heart in
common with the Ancient Britons: whereas the characteristics of
the Saxons, and of the Teutonic race in general, were entirely
opposite.&nbsp; The Normans celebrated the anniversary feasts and
cherished the memory of the Cymric King Arthur of the Round
Table, whose chivalric fame they regarded as much their own as
the Cymri, for he ruled the Celts of Gaul as well as of
Britain.&nbsp; The Cymri therefore looked on with placidity and
satisfaction at the mutual enmity and reprisals of Normans and
Saxons, for they remained unconquered and unmolested in their
upland homes.&nbsp; We find them occasionally under their Princes
making inroads into England, and conquering and retaining much
border territory.&nbsp; The Norman Kings therefore established on
the Welsh borders the Lords-marchers, or Lords authorised <!--
page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>to conquer and hold by the sword land in Wales; and
erected a chain of castles and fortresses from Chester through
Shrewsbury and Gloucester to Pembroke, for the defence of the
frontier, and the repression of sorties from Wales.&nbsp; Hence
the Grosvenors, De Greys, Cliffords, and Mortimers of border
chivalry.&nbsp; Hence also the border wars between them and
Gruffydd ap Conan, Owain Gwynedd, Llewelyn, and other Princes of
Wales, wherein great courage and chivalry were displayed on both
sides, and seldom to the advantage of the Norman.&nbsp; At last,
after ages of bloodshed and war, and repeated failures, the
subjection of the Principality was accomplished, <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1283, by Edward the First, who, to
extinguish the last embers of patriotic fire, massacred upwards
of one hundred Welsh Bards, in addition to many Cymric
Princes.&nbsp; But the Cymri were still discontented and given to
insurrection, until a monarch of their own Tudor blood was placed
on the British throne in the person of Henry the Seventh, <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1485.&nbsp; Henceforward they became
more reconciled to the larger and dominant race, and at length
subsided into peaceful submission and attachment to the British
throne and laws.</p>
<p>But to return to the feudal system strictly so called, we find
the Lords and Barons were all-powerful within their dominions,
and had the power of giving or taking away the life, liberty, and
property of their retainers and vassals.&nbsp; They often made
war upon each other, the consequences of which were frequently
awful in the streams of blood which flowed, and the murder,
rapine, and spoliation which ensued.&nbsp; Evidences of these
internal wars are seen in the ruined castles and dismantled
towers which cover our own country and the continent of
Europe.&nbsp; The Barons would frequently league together, and
make war upon the King or Sovereign, in which they often
triumphed.&nbsp; A remarkable instance of this is found in <!--
page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>English History, when the Barons joined in opposing
King John, and wrested from him Magna Charta at Runnymede.&nbsp;
The De Veres, Bohuns, Mowbrays, Nevilles, Howards, Percys, and
Somersets often overshadowed their sovereign lieges in England;
while the powerful families of Douglas and Scott for ages held
the Kings of Scotland in awe.&nbsp; The Kings and Sovereigns were
more in fear and had greater apprehensions of the feudal Barons,
than from the mass of their subjects, and were therefore often
completely obsequious to their wills.&nbsp; But ever and anon
would arise an Edward or a James, who, defying the enmity of the
feudal chiefs, diminished their powers and restrained their
excesses.&nbsp; Yet this was never done, or even attempted,
without the greatest opposition and danger, and never but by a
brave and formidable Prince.</p>
<p>Each of the great Barons kept a Court, and indulged in a style
of pageantry corresponding in an inferior degree to that of
Royalty, of which he occasionally affected independence.&nbsp;
When the great Earl Warrenne was questioned respecting the right
to his vast land possessions, he drew his sword, saying that was
his title, and that William did not himself conquer England, but
that his ancestor with the rest of the Barons were joint
adventurers in the enterprise.&nbsp; As the Barons were so
powerful, the Sovereign never made war or undertook any other
great enterprise without first convoking and consulting them, as
their co-operation was necessary to his success.&nbsp; In fact,
such was their position in the realm, that no change in the laws
or government, nor any great act of administration, could be
accomplished without their advice and consent.&nbsp; Hence they
formed with the ecclesiastical hierarchy, the sole and supreme
legislative council of the Sovereign.&nbsp; Independently of the
necessity for their advice and co-operation in national
enterprises, the Sovereign <!-- page 194--><a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>was
desirous of convoking the Barons to his councils at stated
periods, as a badge of fealty, and to remind them of their
allegiance to Royalty; which in the autocratic retirement of
their castles, and the solitude of their manors, they were prone
to forget.&nbsp; Whensoever any of the Barons rebelled against
the royal authority, the Sovereign assembled the other Barons to
assist him in suppressing the mutiny.&nbsp; If on the other hand
any Baron should be unable to repel the encroachments of a
neighbor, he appealed to the Sovereign as the supreme liege for
help to resist and punish the aggression, which with the aid of
other chieftains was generally granted.&nbsp; The Sovereign
therefore stood in the same relation to the Barons of the whole
realm, as they individually to their vassals, the feudal theory
being, that all land was held ultimately from the Sovereign in
return for military and other services, failing which it reverted
to the Crown.</p>
<p>The Barons, as may be supposed, exercised unlimited power
within their domains, as the Sovereign never interposed in
questions between the Lord and his vassals, so long as the chief
rendered the services required by the Crown.&nbsp; Hence the
power of each Baron was absolute within his dominions; and from
his acts there was no appeal, much less redress.&nbsp; He even
affected Royalty by obliging his principal vassals to give
attendance upon him, in like manner as he and the other Barons
paid court to the King, and by establishing Courts and Judges of
his own to administer justice to his vassals.&nbsp; In short,
every Barony was a miniature Kingdom, with an army of retainers,
a train of officials, and other insignia of State grandeur
corresponding with the wealth and power of the chief.&nbsp; To
maintain this condition, the Baron was under the necessity of
raising a large revenue from his Barony; and as a great display
of power was essential for the chief, his exactions from the
vassals and all within his <!-- page 195--><a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>power were
consequently heavy.&nbsp; This revenue was obtained from heriots,
fines, and tolls; which being arbitrary, the amount depended on
the want which called it forth, or on the conscience of the
chief.&nbsp; A heriot of the best horse, or certain head of
cattle, or a fine of so many marks, were payable to the Baron on
the marriage or death of his vassal, and on each fresh succession
to the fief.&nbsp; These exactions were not confined to the
immediate vassals and villains, but extended to the whole
population within the limits of the Barony.&nbsp; The towns were
in this era small, consisting principally of villages, which, as
they were situate within some Barony, were equally subjected to
fiscal burdens.&nbsp; These, in addition to heavy fines demanded
for any building, liberty, or encroachment on the manor,
consisted of tolls and duties imposed on the exportation or
importation of goods, and on the sale of horses, cattle, or stock
which, to increase the revenue, were prohibited being sold
outside the vills, or except in the fairs and markets there
licensed to be held, whereupon the tolls attached.&nbsp; By this
means the Baron raised a considerable revenue to support his
power and state.&nbsp; But as the Baron was more hostile to the
trading community or the population of towns, than to his own
military vassals and tenants on the soil, as being less
serviceable to his warlike power, and more antagonistic to, and
discontented with his seignioral privileges,&mdash;he imposed on
the former heavier fiscal burdens, and spared no opportunity of
oppressing them with the most odious extortions.&nbsp; The
military and mercantile spirits have always been antagonistic and
hostile, and the germs of that great conflict which has since
existed, and in recent times been so grandly developed between
the two elements, are plainly discernible in this era&mdash;the
cradle of its history.</p>
<p>But as the boroughs increased, the towns multiplied, and
commerce extended, an antagonistic principle or element <!-- page
196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>to
the powers and privileges of the feudal nobility grew up.&nbsp;
The reigning power having so much cause for dread of the Barons,
was desirous of conciliating the burgher nobility, or the
population of towns, and from time to time made large concessions
or grants in their favor.&nbsp; This was done as much to foster a
rival power or influence to the feudal nobility, as to win over
the towns to the interest of the King.&nbsp; These grants
consisted in charters of incorporation, that the towns might be
freed from the rule of the landed nobility, and might accomplish
their own government; and grants of fairs, and markets, and
tolls, as well as the rights of representation in
parliament.&nbsp; Thus in times past the Kings of Britain were
often in friendlier alliance with the towns and burgher nobility,
than with the feudal Barons and landed aristocracy.&nbsp; By this
means the power and privileges of the feudal nobility, which up
to the fifteenth century were nearly absolute and uncontrollable,
were much reduced, and are in the present reign nearly taken
away.&nbsp; This result has been owing almost entirely to the
growing importance, influence, and intelligence of the burgher or
trading population.&nbsp; It is thus that in political society as
in nature and the material world, results are accomplished by the
antagonistic operation and conflict of rival or opposing
principles, elements, or influences.</p>
<p>The other great influence which counteracted the feudal spirit
from an earlier period, and mitigated its severities, was
religion, or the Church.&nbsp; This was natural and inevitable;
for the overwhelming influence of religion over the human mind in
all ages and nations is the universal deduction of history.&nbsp;
It appears to strike its root even the deeper, in proportion to
the strength and ruggedness of the mind on which it operates, as
plants are more luxuriant from the rankness of the soil where
they grow.&nbsp; The fulminations of Sinai or the dulcet harps of
Zion have <!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>seldom failed in moving the heart of
man, and exciting its tenderest and best emotions.&nbsp; We find
this verified even in the darkest times, and among the most
ferocious nations.&nbsp; Clovis, Charlemange, and William of
Normandy are magnificent illustrations.&nbsp; The first, from
being one of the most ruthless and savage warriors and conquerors
at the head of the Franks ever known in history, no sooner heard
the preaching of the Gospel through the instrumentality of his
wife Clotilda, than he immediately embraced its truths, and by
the most abject humility and self-denying sacrifices for the
remainder of his life endeavored to atone for his past
cruelties.&nbsp; His great successor, Charlemange, less barbarous
and with higher capabilities, at the head of his Germans
vanquished continental Europe after innumerable and ferocious
wars; yet succumbed his lofty spirit to the influence of
Christianity, and prepared by his sword a way for its
missionaries.&nbsp; We also find that William the Conqueror, by
the deepest penitence and remorse, and by large munificence to
the Church, sought to make recompense for the cruelties and
excesses of his reign.</p>
<p>It was therefore inevitable that in the middle ages the
influence of the Church should operate on the feudal Barons, and
soften the rigors of their power.&nbsp; In the vicinity of the
Baronial castle arose a village, whose inhabitants were generally
dependent on the Lord.&nbsp; In the village sprung up a church
and a pastor.&nbsp; The village Priest generally ministered to
the inmates of the castle, as well as to the inhabitants of the
hamlet; and as learning, or even the rudiments of scholarship,
were then confined to the clergy, the religious minister was also
the secretary, teacher, and counsellor of the Baronial
family.&nbsp; He thus acquired influence and mastery over the
youth and age of the circle, and seldom failed to seize the
advantage in imbuing them with his benign creed.&nbsp; Hence <!--
page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>the contrast presented in those ages between the
chieftain in the camp and field, where he was all vigor and
ferocity, and in his own hall, where he displayed many virtues of
the Christian life.&nbsp; Hence also the generally milder
character of the heir apparent and future wielder of the Baronial
power, than of the sire.&nbsp; To this source we may also in a
great measure ascribe the diminishing severity of each succeeding
Baron, and the much more humane and improved conduct and manners
of the late than early chieftains.</p>
<p>But this is regarding religion in its private and spontaneous,
yet in its best influence, in subduing the rigors of the feudal
chiefs.&nbsp; It had a separate, more worldly, but yet powerful
influence in the Church.&nbsp; Constantine the Great made the
Church (which was previously a voluntary and spontaneous
association of Christian people) a national and compulsory
institution, and a fundamental part of the imperial fabric: he
added it to the Roman Empire; succeeding Emperors maintained it;
and it became a preponderating influence in the State.&nbsp; It
was feared that after the irruption of the Barbarians and their
conquest of the Empire, although private belief and individual
creeds might remain and be preserved, yet the Church as a
political element and fabric would inevitably fall and perish in
the imperial ruin.&nbsp; But in this the anticipations of men
failed; for we find that the Goths, Vandals, and Scythians were
equally susceptible of the influence of the religion of Christ,
which many of them and especially their chieftains embraced, and
often aided its progress with the sword.&nbsp; We also find that
as soon as the barbarian conquest of Rome settled into distinct
nationalities and governments, the powers followed the example of
the great Constantine, and added religion to the State, and
constituted the Church a political fabric.&nbsp; In this manner,
before and at the commencement of the middle ages, <!-- page
199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>every European state had its National Church.&nbsp;
This polity existed equally in Britain, where the Church became a
rich and powerful corporation, often rivalling and occasionally
transcending the feudal Barons in wealth, dignities, and
influence.&nbsp; The Prelates of the Church were by law Barons of
the realm.&nbsp; Anselm, in the reigns of William Rufus and the
first Henry,&mdash;Thomas &agrave; Becket, in that of the
second,&mdash;both Archbishops of Canterbury, and Cardinal
Wolsey, in the reign of Henry the Eighth, are illustrations of
the great wealth, power, and dignity which the ecclesiastical
hierarchy from time to time enjoyed in this country.</p>
<p>The extensive wealth and influence of the Church excited the
jealousy and enmity of the feudal Barons, between whom were
continual disputes, which sometimes led to violence and
war.&nbsp; In their progress we find the Bishops and dignitaries
of the Church occasionally substitute the mitre by the helmet,
and the crosier for the sword, and rivalling the feudal
chieftains in their military exploits.&nbsp; We also find the
Church generally allied with Royalty or the sovereign power in
their differences with the feudal Barons; but occasionally with
the latter in curbing the royal prerogative and power.&nbsp; The
Church generally cast its influence into the scale of either
power which might happen to be weakest, and for the purpose of
counterbalancing the opposite power from which there was greatest
apprehension and dread of usurpation and wrong.&nbsp; The
ecclesiastical influence and power were also much courted and
cherished in general by the Kings and Queens of Britain, as a
support to themselves, and a restraint on the feudal chiefs; and
they often, when practicable, seized opportunities of enriching
the ecclesiastical order, and adding to their power.&nbsp; The
Church also sometimes lent its aid and influence to the popular
triumph and cause.&nbsp; <!-- page 200--><a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>It is,
therefore, evident that the feudal system met with much
antagonism and counteraction from the Church, and that its rigors
were much diminished in consequence.&nbsp; The beneficial effects
which followed were not always owing to the purest motives, or
the benevolence of the Church; but more frequently from the
desire of maintaining its own privileges and wealth.&nbsp; But
the results to the nation and its liberties were the same as if
the ecclesiastical hierarchy had been actuated by higher motives
and a purer spirit; and the well-being of the community, was
equally promoted.</p>
<p>The Church and the boroughs, in conjunction with the royal
power, therefore served to subdue the feudal spirit, and restrain
and diminish the powers and privileges of its chiefs.</p>
<p>The effects of the Commonwealth under Cromwell must also have
struck fatally at the rigors of the feudal system, in common with
many other oppressions, from which they never revived.&nbsp; The
spirit of the Commonwealth was deeply hostile to all kinds of
ancient tyrrany; and as the feudal law was one of the greatest,
it received a serious check.&nbsp; The genius of Puritanism
rebelled against the feudal distinctions, as the spirit of
liberty which was then triumphant overcame its oppressions.&nbsp;
The Baron could no longer at the sound of his horn assemble his
ferocious retinue of vassals and retainers, to march to the
conquest of political foes, or the suppression of uprising
liberty.&nbsp; The Knight could no more ride abroad in his
panoply of steel, feared and unopposed by a rabble of villeins
and serfs.&nbsp; The spirit of the nation was aroused to its
inmost depths in the great struggle for emancipation, and
statesmen and warriors arose from its lowest estates.&nbsp; The
popular Fairfax overcame the princely Rupert; while the great
Commoner&mdash;Cromwell&mdash;overthrew Royalty itself.&nbsp;
<!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>Chivalry had to surrender its crest at Newbury, Marston
Moor, and Naseby, to popular bravery and religious zeal.&nbsp;
The ancient order of things was entirely changed, and new
institutions everywhere took its place, founded on the democratic
power.&nbsp; Brewers and butchers now occupied the seats in the
Senate formerly held by Barons and Knights; while Fleetwood and
Harrison commanded the army of Manchester and Essex.&nbsp; No
greater contrast existed than that of the Puritan captain with
his skull cap, buff coat, and leather buskins, and the Cavalier
with plumed hat, velvet cloak, and silk hose.&nbsp; Not more
opposite were they in character than attire: the former a grave,
stern, austere, gloomy, and religious democrat; the latter a gay,
lively, free-thinking, licentious, and haughty aristocrat: the
first was the impersonation of religious faith and prowess; the
last of feudal pride.&nbsp; It was therefore inevitable, that in
the course of that great struggle between the two elements which
ended in the triumph of the popular cause and the establishment
of the Commonwealth, feudal arrogance and oppression received a
fatal shock.</p>
<p>The leading principle or idea embodied in the feudal system
was that of a head, or chief, with dependence by the vassals and
retainers.&nbsp; The same principle pervades our laws and
institutions, and is in a great measure the fruit or effect of
the feudal polity.&nbsp; Among other instances of its operation
we may mention the law of primogeniture, the object being to
create a family chief.&nbsp; The property qualifications
necessary for parliamentary rights and representation, for the
magistracy, and other stations of power and dignity, are
illustrations of the same effect.&nbsp; The Peers sit and vote in
the Upper House of Parliament as Barons of the Realm; while the
Members for counties in the other House are returned as Knights
of the Shire; and the Judges of the land are designated Barons of
the <!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>Exchequer, or Knights&rsquo;
Justices; and the parliamentary Members for boroughs are styled
Burgesses,&mdash;thus still retaining their feudal
distinctions.&nbsp; The preponderance everywhere given to
property in land, over wealth in money, trade, or other moveable
goods, is a result of the same policy.&nbsp; Indeed it may be
said, that the leading principles which govern property in this
Kingdom, have their main origin and foundation in the feudal
system; although the legislation of the last half century has
done much to abolish the enormities with which it was theretofore
disfigured.</p>
<p>But it may be asked, what were the effects of the system which
we have briefly sketched?&nbsp; Were they good or evil?&nbsp; Did
they advance or retard human society and civilization?&nbsp;
These are difficult and important questions, in the solution of
which probably few will entirely agree.</p>
<p>That the feudal state was rendered necessary by the
circumstances of the period, we have, we think, sufficiently
shown.&nbsp; That its influence has been in some respects
beneficial is also incontestible.&nbsp; The predominant feature
of the feudal dominion was force&mdash;physical force; and this
was the only one suited and practicable for the barbarian
population of Europe in the middle centuries.&nbsp; Reason and
right were terms unknown and foreign to the masses then emerging
from uncivilized life.&nbsp; Force was their own law, and by this
must they themselves have been ruled.&nbsp; The Baron or Lord, in
enforcing the severities of the feudal code, therefore instructed
his vassals in a vocabulary which they understood; he governed
them by the only suitable rod.&nbsp; To have addressed them as
citizens, and moral and accountable beings, and to have explained
to them their duties and rights from a description of the nature,
condition, and destinies of man, would have been to have spoken
to them in an unknown tongue&mdash;in a language they could not
have understood.</p>
<p><!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>Moreover the very relation in which the vassals stood
to their Lord, and the services and duties which they were
compelled to perform, taught them obedience&mdash;trained them to
docility and submission.&nbsp; It induced them to reflect on
others than themselves,&mdash;to regard the wants and rights of
others beside their own.&nbsp; This was a great point gained in
subduing and training the barbarian just leaving his roving life
in the forest or on the mountain.&nbsp; This was a step to
further improvement, and to a milder and more rational rule; by
this he was trained for a gentler government, and better
laws.</p>
<p>The feudal institutions gave birth to chivalry, which
exercised so predominant a sway through the middle ages, and in
what light soever it is regarded, was beneficial in its
influences.&nbsp; It conjures up to our mind the brilliant scenes
and magnificent achievements of the period, whether viewed in the
enchanting pages of romance, or the more sober records of
history.&nbsp; It brings before our minds the mail-clad warrior
dispensing refined hospitality in his armor-hung hall, to a
princely retinue of retainers and guests, or mounted on his fiery
steed, pressing forward to the mortal encounters of honor.&nbsp;
The Knight is equally interesting, whether we look at him armed
to avenge in single combat the maiden&rsquo;s dishonor or
orphan&rsquo;s wrong, or we follow him into the stately
tournament, there to encounter in the perilous and sometimes
fatal lists.&nbsp; In either case we see displayed the highest
qualities of man&mdash;courage, honor, dignity, fidelity, skill,
and manly strength.&nbsp; We find the same characteristics
accompany him into the tented field, where amidst hills of
carnage, and at the close of a doubtful day, the bleeding knight
contends bravely under the shadow of the red-cross banner.&nbsp;
The crusades were a magnificent effect of the religious
aspiration of chivalry, whatsoever opinion may now be formed of
the policy of those great contests.&nbsp; <!-- page 204--><a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>No sight
more glorious can be imagined than the chivalry of the West
marching triumphantly through the heart of Europe to avenge the
wrongs and indignities of the Cross upon the Infidel, and contend
against four-fold odds under the walls of Antioch and Jerusalem,
to recover the Holy Sepulchre from the pollution of Moslem
hands.&nbsp; Whatsoever opinion the sober philosophy of history
may now pronounce on these great wars, they were dictated by the
highest aspirations, and ennobled by the most heroic actions, and
they stand out nobly on the headlands of the past as monuments of
human grandeur.</p>
<p>Although we have only viewed the institution of chivalry in
its outward and more attractive aspects, yet it inculcated a high
code of personal morality, very beneficial in the feudal
ages.&nbsp; In this era the law was feeble, and its
administration so often fruitless, that the greatest restraint on
power, and the best security for the rights of individuals, and
more especially of the weak, was personal honor; and this in its
highest sense was generally characteristic of the barons and
knights.&nbsp; They as frequently armed to redress the wrongs of
the weak as to avenge their own personal injuries.&nbsp; The
maiden&rsquo;s wail, the orphan&rsquo;s cry, were to them the
most potent spring of action for the most fatal rencontres.&nbsp;
The faithless knight who might happen to injure virgin purity, or
oppress unarmed and defenceless people, roused the resentment of
the whole order of chivalry, and was pursued from castle to
cloister, and from land to land, till his blood atoned for his
lust or cruelty.&nbsp; Chivalry inculcated upon its members the
highest honor, fidelity, truth, and justice; and in the absence
of strong public law, administered equally with a powerful and
impartial hand, formed the best code of law and morals in the
feudal times.&nbsp; We find examples of faithless barons and
recreant knights, as there are exceptions to every rule, and
blots upon every picture; yet in the main <!-- page 205--><a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>the very
code in which they were instructed, and the habits which they
acquired had a most beneficial influence in the formation of
their characters, and furnished many illustrious examples of
human virtue, and public renown.</p>
<p>The feudal system was, moreover, fertile of the military
spirit, and this in its fullest vigor was necessary for the
defence of the nation, as well as of individuals, in the dark
ages.&nbsp; The feudal polity was first established by the
sagacious Conqueror, as a military structure to overawe the
vanquished Saxon; and though its rigor became relaxed in after
reigns, yet its very existence rested on military organization,
and the education of the soldier was its chief aim; the
cultivation of the soil and the pursuits of commerce, being
regarded as secondary and inferior occupations, and were treated
with disdain by the feudal chiefs.&nbsp; Hence the universal
predominance of military power and rank in the middle ages, and
their monopoly of distinction and wealth.&nbsp; Hence also the
paucity of mercantile greatness in those times.</p>
<p>As the martial discipline and organization of his retainers
and vassals was necessary to the supremacy of the Baron, so the
co-operative forces of the Barons were necessary for the
maintenance of the throne, and the safety of the kingdom.&nbsp;
The former was in continual peril from domestic ambition and
discord, and the latter from foreign foes.&nbsp; A Montfort and a
Neville, a Percy and a Douglas, were only restrained from
subverting the royal power, and grasping the sceptre in their own
hands, by the support given by the other Barons to the
sovereign,&mdash;evinced on many a well-fought field.&nbsp; The
invasion of the kingdom by continental armies, was only prevented
by the confederate array of the King and his Barons.</p>
<p>In the absence of that division of employment which <!-- page
206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>in
modern times produced a standing army, the feudal organization
with its martial aspect alone supplied the nation with its
defence.&nbsp; No sooner did the Frank or Northman display his
banner on the wave, for the conquest of Britain, than hill
signalled hill, from Devon to the Orkneys, to summon the united
Barons to the defence of the realm.&nbsp; With such alacrity was
the alarm obeyed, that before a hostile flag could be planted on
the headlands of the island, the enemy was driven into the sea,
or to the refuge of his ships; leaving full many behind to attest
the folly of the expedition.&nbsp; Not less ready were the feudal
chiefs to follow the British ensign into foreign wars, there to
sustain the glory of its fame.&nbsp; Poietiers and Azincour,
Steinkirk and Landen, Ramilies and Blenheim, witnessed the heroic
prowess of English chivalry on their hard-fought fields, while
the terrible charge of the British infantry passed into the
proverbs of those lands.&nbsp; From this system sprang an Essex
and a Raleigh, a Chandos and a Churchill, with other great
captains of the British hosts, who, by the military organization
and discipline which it afforded to the nation, were enabled
during the reigns of the Plantagenets, the Tudors, and the
Stuarts to preserve our soil inviolate from a foreign foe, and to
force entire Europe into respect and homage of the British
name.</p>
<p>It is also true that the Baron, his family, domestics, and
retainers, were in this era the only persons who possessed any
scholarship, learning, or even good manners.&nbsp; The interior
of the castle was graced with beauty, order, and comparative
refinement.&nbsp; There letters and learning were sought after,
if not largely acquired.&nbsp; Good manners and regularity
prevailed.&nbsp; The Baron himself spent much of his time in the
bosom of his family, and must have been improved in the gentler
circle which there assembled.&nbsp; He for a time lost the
bluntness and ferocity of his warlike <!-- page 207--><a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>life.&nbsp;
A priest, or minister of religion, was also generally an
appendage of the castle; and his profession, being an improving,
learned, and pacific one, must have acted beneficially on those
with whom he associated.&nbsp; The instruction and example of the
inmates of the castle must therefore have been beneficial to the
whole feudal society around: to which may be added the historical
fact that after the introduction of the feudal system, and by the
sanction and encouragement of the Barons, were compiled the only
literary works of the period of which we have any account.&nbsp;
In the solitudes of the baronial castle were composed the only
chronicles of that era which have descended to us.&nbsp; Within
the walls of the castellated abode generally dwelt the priests,
bards, and other literati of the time; where they had leisure and
encouragement to pursue their avocations; and thence issued forth
their chronicles, poems, and productions.&nbsp; These influences
must, therefore, have tended greatly to the civilization and
improvement of the whole feudal society.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we must not overlook the fact that the
feudal state was decidedly hostile to general freedom&mdash;its
very nature militated against general liberty&mdash;its existence
was inconsistent with progress and the spread of freedom and
intelligence.&nbsp; The continuance and influence of the feudal
dominion depended on the passive submission of all the
inhabitants of the domain.&nbsp; Every manifestation of
discontent or uneasiness on the part of the latter was,
therefore, watched by the chief with a jealous eye; every attempt
at disobedience was punished with severity.&nbsp; The chief
warded off all principles dangerous to his own monopoly of
power.&nbsp; All struggles for general liberty were crushed with
an unrelenting hand.&nbsp; The great and only desire of the Baron
was to perpetuate the then existing system.&nbsp; Every attempt
at amelioration was alike inimical to his wishes and power.</p>
<p><!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>The feudal dominion was also extremely prejudicial to
the nation in the inveterate hostility which it manifested to
commerce, agriculture, and productive industry.&nbsp; Military
power and strength being its chief aim, all pursuits which tended
to divert the people from martial exercises and display were
discouraged by the feudal chiefs.&nbsp; Hence the cultivation and
improvement of the soil was but feebly prosecuted, while the
pursuits of commerce and mercantile enterprise were opposed and
repressed, from a suspicion of their antagonism to the feudal
dominion.&nbsp; The Baron delighted in extensive chases, and
parks studded with trees, and covered with brushwood, where game
might take refuge; and in vast forests and barren uplands, where
the deer and the hare might wander undisturbed; while the furrow
of the corn-field and the hedge-row were restricted to the
smallest dimensions consistent with the necessities of the
population of the manor.&nbsp; The hound was more valued than the
sheep-dog; the fowling-piece than the sickle; while herds of wild
deer browsing the slopes were more estimated than the oxen on the
plain.&nbsp; The huntsman and gamekeeper held higher rank than
the ploughman and reaper; while all the prizes of ambition lay
open to martial enterprise alone.</p>
<p>But to none was the hostility of the feudal chiefs more
rancorous than to the pursuits of commerce.&nbsp; The most odious
of sights was the tall chimney of a manufactory peering through
the oak and elm of the chase; while the pollution of mills and
workshops on the banks of pellucid streams was not to be
borne.&nbsp; The mines of the mountain were closed, lest their
produce might destroy the salmon and trout of the rivers; while
houses and ships were left unbuilt, that the forests be not
denuded of their stately timber.</p>
<p>The hostility of the feudal chiefs to mercantile progress <!--
page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>was the more inveterate, from a feeling and knowledge
of its antagonism to their own irresponsible power.&nbsp; Every
manufactory which was set up bore a brow of hostility to the
castle; while every town was in feud with the manor.&nbsp; In
every war or tumult the towns and commercial villages ranged
their forces in opposition to the Baron and his clan; and
whensoever an opportunity offered for suppressing and subverting
the feudal dominion and privileges, the mercantile community
never failed to raise the axe and strike at their root.</p>
<p>The Barons, therefore, manifested the utmost dislike and
hostility to the progress of manufactures and towns.&nbsp; Seldom
could a fitting site for a village or manufactory be found except
within the limits of a manor; and the lord, if he even conceded
the liberty for the erection, never failed to burden the grant
with exorbitant rents and exactions, and to fetter it with the
most oppressive restrictions.&nbsp; These grants would never have
been made, only for the temptation of gold.&nbsp; The feudal
chiefs were, from their ostentatious power and display, mostly
poor; and in exchange for a high rent or large purchase money,
they were induced to grant tracts of land to the manufacturer and
merchant, whose money capital was the only bait for the cupidity
of the proprietor.&nbsp; Hence, from the reign of Edward the
First onwards, the conflict of capital representing commerce, and
territorial interest representing the lords of the soil.&nbsp;
The former power, feeble at first, grew steadily under the more
favorable reigns of succeeding monarchs, and in modern times has
made such strides, as to equal, if not surpass, the ancient
dominion of the fief.</p>
<p>Moreover, the excessive power of the Barons was full of danger
to the peace and security of the realm.&nbsp; Where the dominion
and government of the mass of the people were in so few hands,
the peril of the nation was great <!-- page 210--><a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>from the
discontent or ambition of one or more of the chiefs.&nbsp; A
Mowbray, Bohun, Mortimer, or Clifford, could at the head of his
clan disarrange the affairs of the entire kingdom, and plunge the
nation into war.&nbsp; This danger was also increased from the
turbulent disposition of the Barons.&nbsp; The feudal chiefs
dwelt apart in the strongholds of their castles, and the solitude
of their manors, and exercised unlimited dominion and sovereignty
over the inhabitants of their domains.&nbsp; Their mode of life
and irresponsible power generated an independence and
insubordination which could ill brook restraint or abridgment
even from the sovereign, setting aside from another chieftain,
and which often broke out in open rebellion, defying even the
power of the crown.&nbsp; Hence the insurrection of a Leicester,
a Warwick, and a Northumberland, which required the utmost force
of the sovereign and his confederate Barons to subdue.&nbsp;
Hence also the intestine commotions and civil wars which were so
prevalent in the feudal ages, and which from time to time
paralysed the progress of the nation, and occasioned the
sacrifice of innumerable lives.</p>
<p>The feudal dominion was, in the last place, very unfavorable
to art, science, and discovery.&nbsp; Its chiefs had little
leisure from foreign wars and domestic tumult for their
prosecution, and had less inclination to encourage their
promotion by others.&nbsp; Their attention was absorbed in
schemes of territorial aggrandisement and political intrigue, as
to devote little time to the improvement of the mind.&nbsp; The
only learning which they patronised was the mummeries of monkish
superstition and priestly adulation.&nbsp; True science was
neglected, or even discouraged.&nbsp; We do not find one name
throughout the dark and stormy reigns of the Plantagenets which
may rank in the first class of scientific merit.&nbsp; We must
descend to the Tudors before we meet with any light to dispel the
Egyptian darkness which enveloped science.&nbsp; It was the reign
of the virgin <!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span

embellished by that galaxy of illustrious stars in the firmament
of discovery, which mapped out new and more useful paths for
investigation, and will shed everlasting light upon
science.&nbsp; It was in this epoch when the feudal dominion had
been shorn of much or most of its pristine glory, and when
commerce and manufactures were encouraged, and the liberty of the
subject was more secure&mdash;that a Bacon, a Raleigh, a Camden
and a Davis, arose to delight and bless mankind with their
magnificent discoveries.&nbsp; The paths shadowed out by these
great names were afterwards pursued under still more auspicious
reigns, throughout which we find a joint alliance and equal
progress between mercantile grandeur and civil freedom, and their
hand-maiden science.&nbsp; In these latter times we meet with a
Newton, a Davy, a Watt, and a Stephenson, whose discoveries and
works have yoked matter to accomplish the purposes of man, and
made the elements tributary to his designs.&nbsp; It is likewise
more than probable that had the human mind in modern times not
emancipated itself from feudal servility and thraldom, Britain
and the world would have been deprived of these universal
blessings, and our own glorious island would at present hold
little or no higher rank in Europe than benighted Spain, or the
Italian peninsula.</p>
<p>Now that the pomp, glory, and circumstance of the feudal state
have passed away, we may leisurely look back on its history,
contemplate its features, and observe its effects and
tendencies.&nbsp; In this retrospect we are encouraged by the
better condition of the age in which we live, and the brightening
prospects of the future.&nbsp; But in all our inquiries and
wanderings let us never forget that man has in all ages been
inconstant, and human nature imperfect, and that the best of all
institutions are probably those which approximate the laws that
Solon gave to the Athenians; who said, &ldquo;My laws are not the
best ones possible, but they are the best which the Athenians can
bear.&rdquo;</p>

BRECONSHIRE AND RADNORSHIRE<br />
Mineral Springs.</h2>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Part I. (Breconshire) is from the pen of the Rev. James Rhys
Jones (Kilsby.)&nbsp; Part II. (Radnorshire, &amp;c.,) has been
compiled by the Publisher.&nbsp; The two chapters on the
Medicinal Properties of the Waters are from the pen of R.
Richardson, Esq., L.F.P.S.G., Fellow of the Obstetrical Society
of London, Surgeon, Rhayader.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Opinions of the Press.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very interesting little book; in a very small
compass, it contains a great deal of useful and interesting
information relative to the Welsh mineral springs, coupled with a
variety of legendary and antiquarian lore; descriptions of
scenery, and the various other adjuncts necessary to make up a
good guide book.&nbsp; Every one who purposes visiting the
springs should procure a copy, and even those who do not intend
visiting the localities described, will find a variety of
entertaining matter in this very agreeable and pleasant little
book.&nbsp; We ought to mention that a portion of the work has
been compiled by the Rev J. R. Jones, (late of Kilsby,) and that
it contains a valuable chapter on the medicinal properties of the
various springs, from the pen of R. Richardson, Esq.,
<i>Surgeon</i>, of Rhayader.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Shropshire
Conservative</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;The caprice of fashion has rendered famous many old
corners of the earth, while others more deserving the notice of
the great world lie hidden in unmerited obscurity, or at the most
have obtained but a mere local celebrity.&nbsp; The spas of
Germany are frequented by quite as many of the votaries of
dissipation, and <i>Rouge et Noir</i>, as of the seekers after
the blessings of health; but there are secluded valleys in our
own country which are to the full as deserving of the visits of
the lover of the beautiful, and the tired out workman in the
world&rsquo;s great treadmill, while to the invalid they offer
medicaments of nature&rsquo;s own composition, and scenes
untainted by the follies of the frivolous, or the vices of the
designing, who throng the gilded saloons of Hamburg and Baden to
prey upon the gay and gilded butterflies of fashion.&nbsp; To
such the little book whose title we quote above will prove a
faithful, and we believe a welcome guide&mdash;for its
unpretending pages contain not merely a great amount of
information, but also a considerable fund of recreative
reading.&nbsp; Almost every line of the chapters comprising the
first part betrays the writer&rsquo;s well-know hand.&nbsp;
Unlike as Charles Lamb and Carlyle are to each other, and unlike
as he is to either, there is much in his style that reminds us of
both; there is much of the genial quaint humour of the one, and
much, very much, of the eccentricity of the other.&nbsp; There is
no mistaking the pen, whether it is employed in graphically
sketching with a few rapid touches the picturesque scenery of
woodland glen, or wide expanse of solitary moor, or glorious
mountain side grand with precipice, and beautiful with heather
bloom&mdash;or whether it is rendering homage to the memory of
some worthy of other days, who first saw light among those
hills&mdash;or whether it is with the frolic humour of a
Cerfantes giving a vivid word-picture of an exploring expedition,
mounted on a batch of Abergwessin ponies&mdash;it is still <span
class="smcap">original</span>, and will be recognised all over
Wales as wielded by no other hand than that of
&ldquo;Kilsby,&rdquo; by which designation the Rev. James Rhys
Jones is by common consent distinguished from the ten thousand
and one of his compatriots who rejoice in the same surname.&nbsp;
We can scarcely conceive the possibility of his doing anything
and not doing it <i>earnestly</i>, but this has evidently been a
labour of love, for is it not a description of that Valley of the
Irvon which he thus apostrophises?&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thou birth-place and resting place of my humble
forefathers, wisely and not too well have I loved thee; when I
sojourned in the land of the noble and generous Saxon thou wert
my thought by day and my dream by night; it was my uppermost wish
to close my life in thy bosom; I have loved thee with a love
second only to that of woman, and a passion which sober men
pronounce madness: it matters not, for I can pray with the
Westmoreland Bard, &ldquo;Thou valley embrace me, and ye
mountains shut me in.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The remaining portion of the book is chiefly a
compilation, but one that has been well and judiciously
performed.&nbsp; Mr. Pryse has succeeded in getting from a
variety of sources pretty nearly every thing that can possibly
interest, inform, or amuse, in connection not only with the
mineral springs, but also with the beautiful district in which
they are situated.&nbsp; For the invalid he has brought together
the various analyses of the waters, made from time to time, with
the opinions of medical men as to the best rules for their
administration; for the scientific he has produced the opinions
of geologists as to the causes of the impregnation of the waters,
with their health-giving constituents; for the antiquarian he has
collected all that remains of the annals of the ruined abbeys and
castles within a wide circuit, especially all that is known of
the history of the last hours of the gallant Llewellyn, last
native Prince of Wales, whose sad fate has given such melancholy
interest to the vicinity of Builth; and for the poet and the
lover of the marvellous he has recorded the wondrous legends,
which in days gone by, were supposed to account for the healing
powers of the springs without resorting to the philosophic
theories of the Murchisons or Richardsons of those times.&nbsp;
In short, he has produced a &ldquo;Handbook,&rdquo; the
possession of which will doubly enhance the pleasure of a summer
ramble amid the scenes which it describes.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
Monmouthshire Merlin</i>.</p>

<p>It seems by Gwalchmai&rsquo;s poem to have been a very large
fleet, which came partly from Ireland, partly from the Baltic,
and the rest from Normandy, to invade the principality.&nbsp; It
is plain that its forces were numerous, as they came from so many
countries; but it seems they met with a very warm reception from
the prince and his sons, and that they were glad to sail away as
soon as possible.</p>

Wales, and was a noted Bard, as several of his poems, now extant,
testify.</p>
<p><a name="footnote26b"></a><a href="#citation26b"
class="footnote">[26b]</a>&nbsp; It seems that the fleet landed
in some part of the firth of Menai, and that it was a kind of a
mixed engagement, some fighting on shore, others from the
ships.&nbsp; And probably the great slaughter was owing to its
being low water, and that they could not set sail: otherwise I
see no reason why, when they were worsted on land, they should
continue the fight in their ships.&nbsp; It is very plain that
they were in great distress, and that there was a great havoc
made of them, as appears from the remainder of this very spirited
poem.</p>

Arthur, and his treacherous nephew Medrod happened, who had
usurped the sovereignty while he was absent on a foreign

historians, slew Medrod with his own hand; but received his
death-wound himself, and retired to Ynys Afallon or Glastenbury,

concealed, lest it should dispirit the Britons.&nbsp; Hence arose
so many fabulous stories about it.</p>

<p><a name="footnote38b"></a><a href="#citation38b"
class="footnote">[38b]</a>&nbsp; It was the policy of the British
princes to make the Bards foretell their success in war, in order
to spirit up their people to brave actions.&nbsp; Upon which
account the vulgar supposed them to be real prophets.&nbsp; Hence
the great veneration they had for the prophetical Bards, Myrddin
Emrys, Taliesin, and Myrddin Wyllt.&nbsp; This accounts for what
the English writers say of the Welsh relying so much upon the
prophecies of Myrddin.&nbsp; There are many of these pretended
prophecies still extant.&nbsp; The custom of prophecying did not
cease till Henry the Seventh&rsquo;s time, and the reason is
obvious.</p>

Solway Frith.&nbsp; This battle is mentioned in the Triads, and
was fought by Gwenddolau ap Ceidiaw and Aeddan Fradawg, petty
princes of the North, against Rhydderch Hael, king of Cumbria,
who got the battle.&nbsp; Myrddin Wyllt, or Merlin, the

Fychan, and has in his custody a grant from prince Llewelyn the
Great of some lands in Creuddyn given to the said Ednyfed, and
his posterity, with the prince&rsquo;s seal in green wax affixed
to it.&nbsp; To this worthy gentleman, and his lady, I am much
obliged for their civility when I lived in those parts.&mdash;The
royal family of the Tudors are likewise descended from Ednyfed
Fychan, as appears by a commission that was sent to the Bards and
Heralds of Wales, to enquire into the pedigree of Owain Tudor,
king Henry the Seventh&rsquo;s grandfather.</p>

class="footnote">[47b]</a>&nbsp; Urien Reged, a famous king of
Cumbria, who fought valiantly with the Saxons, whose brave
actions are celebrated by Taliesin and Llywarch Hen.&nbsp; He is
mentioned by Nennius, the ancient British historian, who wrote
about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 858.&nbsp; This writer is
terribly mangled by his editors, both at home and abroad, from
their not being versed in the British language.&nbsp; I have
collected some manuscripts of his history, but cannot meet a
genuine one without the interpolations of Samuel Beulan,
otherwise I would publish it.&nbsp; I have in my possession many
notes upon this author, collected from ancient British
manuscripts, as well as English writers, who have treated of our
affairs.&nbsp; This I have been enabled to do, chiefly by having
access to the curious library at Llannerch, by the kind
permission of the late Robert Davies, Esquire, and since by his
worthy son, John Davies, Esquire, which I take this opportunity
gratefully to acknowledge.</p>
<p><a name="footnote47c"></a><a href="#citation47c"
class="footnote">[47c]</a>&nbsp; Cywryd.&nbsp; This Bard is not
mentioned either by Mr. Davies or Mr. Edward Llwyd, in their
catalogues of British writers.&nbsp; It seems he flourished in
the sixth century, as did all the ancient British Bards we have
now extant.&nbsp; Here let me obviate what may be objected to me
as mentioning so many facts, and persons who lived in the sixth
century, within the course of this performance.&nbsp; It was the
last period our kings fought with any success against the Saxons,
and it was natural, therefore, for the Bards of those times, to
record such gallant acts of their princes, and for their
successors to transmit them to posterity.&nbsp; Every person,
though but slightly versed in the British history of that time,
knows that Cadwaladr was the last king of Britain.&nbsp; Since
his time there are no works of the Bards extant till after the
conquest, as I have shewed in my Dissertatio de Bardis.</p>
<p><a name="footnote47d"></a><a href="#citation47d"
class="footnote">[47d]</a>&nbsp; Dunawd, the son of Pabo Post

valiantly with the Saxons.</p>
<p><a name="footnote48a"></a><a href="#citation48a"
class="footnote">[48a]</a>&nbsp; Afan Ferddig, was the Bard of
the famous Cadwallon, son of Cadfan king of Britain.&nbsp; I have
got a fragment of a poem of his composition on the death of his
patron Cadwallon; and as far as I understand it, it is a noble
piece, but very obscure on account of its great antiquity; as are
the works of all the Bards who wrote about this time.&nbsp; It is
as difficult a task, for a modern Welshman to endeavour to
understand those venerable remains, as for a young scholar just
entered upon the study of the Greek language to attack Lycophron
or Pindar, without the help of a dictionary or scholiast.&nbsp;
How Mr. Macpherson has been able to translate the Erse used in
the time of Ossian, who lived a whole century at least before the
earliest British Bard now extant, I cannot comprehend.&nbsp; I
wish some of those that are well versed in the Erse or Irish
language, would be so kind to the public, as to clear these
matters; for I can hardly believe that the Erse language hath
been better preserved than the British.</p>
<p><a name="footnote48b"></a><a href="#citation48b"
class="footnote">[48b]</a>&nbsp; Cadwallon, the son of Cadfan,
the most victorious king of Britain, fought many battles with the
Saxons; and, among the rest, that celebrated one of Meugen, in
which he slew Edward king of Mercia, where the men of Powys
behaved themselves with distinguished bravery; and had from
thence several privileges granted them by that brave
prince.&nbsp; These privileges are mentioned by Cynddelw Brydydd
Mawr, a Powysian Bard, in a poem entitled &ldquo;Breintiau Gwyr
Powys,&rdquo; or the Privileges of the men of Powys, which is in
my custody.</p>

line.</p>

and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
